 * Configuration for the TestAM application.  TestAM sends active message 
 * broadcasts at 1Hz and blinks LED 0 whenever it has sucessfully sent a 
 * broadcast. Whenever it receives one of these broadcasts from another 
 * node, it blinks LED 1.  It uses the radio HIL component <tt>ActiveMessageC</tt>, 
 * and its packets are AM type 240.  This application is useful for testing 
 * AM communication and the ActiveMessageC component.
