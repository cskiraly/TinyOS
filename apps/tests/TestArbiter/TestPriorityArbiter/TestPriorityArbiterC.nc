/**
 * TestPriorityArbiter Application  
 * This application is used to test the functionality of the FcfsPriorityArbiter 
 * component developed using the Resource and ResourceUser interfaces.
 * <br>
 * In this test there are 4 users of one ressource. The Leds indicate which
 * user is the owner of the resource:<br>
 * <li> normal priority client 1  - led 0
 * <li> normal priority client 2  - led 1
 * <li> power manager             - led 2
 * <li> high priority client      - led 0 and led 1 and led 2
 * <br><br>
 * The short flashing of the according leds inidicate that a user has requested the
 * resource. The users have the following behaviour:<br><br>
 * <li> Normal priority clients are idle for a period of time before requesting the resource. 
 *      If they are granted the resource they will use it for a specific amount of time before releasing it.
 * <li> Power manager only request the resource if its idle. It releases the resource immediatly 
 *       if there is a request from another client.
 * <li> High priority client behaves like a normal client but it will release the resource 
 *      after a shorter period of time if there are requests from other clients.
 * <br><br>
 * The poliy of the arbiter should be FirstComeFirstServed with one exception: 
 * If the high priority client requests the resource, the resource will be granted to the 
 * high priority client after the release of the current owner regardless of the internal queue of the arbiter. After
 * the high priority client releases the resource the normal FCFS arbitration resumes.
