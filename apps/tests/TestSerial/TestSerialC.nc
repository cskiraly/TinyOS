/**
 * Application to test that the TinyOS java toolchain can communicate
 * with motes over the serial port. The application sends packets to
 * the serial port at 1Hz: the packet contains an incrementing
 * counter. When the application receives a counter packet, it
 * displays the bottom three bits on its LEDs. This application is
 * very similar to RadioCountToLeds, except that it operates over the
 * serial port. There is Java application for testing the mote
 * application: run TestSerial to print out the received packets and
 * send packets to the mote.
