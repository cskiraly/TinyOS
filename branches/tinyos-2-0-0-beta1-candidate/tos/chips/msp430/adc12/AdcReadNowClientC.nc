/** 
 * Please refer to TEP 101 for more information about this component and its
 * intended use. This component allows a client to access the MSP430 ADC12
 * (12-bit analog-to-digital converter) via the <code>ReadNow</code> and
 * <code>Resource</code> interface. According to TEP 108 a client must reserve
 * the ADC before using it via the <code>Resource</code> interface (otherwise
 * the request will fail).  A client must wire the
 * <code>Msp430Adc12Config</code> interface to a component that returns its
 * ADC12 configuration data. Depending on the REF_VOLT_AUTO_CONFIGURE switch
 * (defined in Msp430Adc12.h) the internal reference voltage generator is
 * automatically enabled if and only if the configuration data includes VREF as
 * reference voltage. Then the <code>Resource.granted()</code> event implies
 * that the reference voltage is stable.
