TestSchedulerTemp is a simple test application for the temporary 
SchedulerTemp that provides TinyOS 2.0 task semantics through the 
1.x mechanism (function pointers). This is only to exist until we
have a version of nesC that works properly with 2.0.
The application has three tasks, each of
which toggles a different LED after a brief spin loop.

This application has little (if any) use to a TinyOS user; it is intended
to be a basic sanity test for SchedulerTemp.
