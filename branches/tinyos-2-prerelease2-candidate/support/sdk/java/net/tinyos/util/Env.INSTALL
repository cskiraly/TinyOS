To install the JNI library for getenv (on x86 Linux and Windows with cygwin):
  cd <your tinyos-1.x directory>/tools/java/jni
  make install
(on Linux you'll have to do this last step as root)

If this doesn't work, check that the locate_jre script is correctly reporting the
location of your java installation's jre directory. If not, copy libgetenv.so 
(Linux) or getenv.dll (Windows) to the appropriate location for your Java VM.
