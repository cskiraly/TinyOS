Welcome to TinyOS 2.0

TinyOS 2.0 has been designed by a working group comprised of companies
and institutions hailing from three continents
(http://www.tinyos.net/scoop/special/working_group_tinyos_2-0).  A
primary 2.0 design goal was to maximize TinyOS' platform portability,
a goal that led to the adaption of the 2.0 Hardware Abstraction
Architecture (HAA). All of the TinyOS 2.0 design is described in the
TinyOS Extension Protocol (TEP) documents linked from the 
TinyOS Working Group page (see link above).

TEP   2: Hardware Abstraction Architecture
TEP 101: ADC
TEP 102: Timers
TEP 106: Schedulers and Tasks 
TEP 107: Boot Sequence
TEP 108: Resource Arbitration
TEP 109: Sensorboards
TEP 110: Service Distributions
TEP 111: message_t
TEP 112: Microcontroller Power Management
TEP 113: Serial Communication

In addition to the design changes described in the above TEPs, 2.0 also
includes infrastructure changes. The directory structure has been modified
to enhance platform portability and ease of use, and TinyOS 2.0 
requires Tinyos-Tools 1.2 as well as NesC 1.2. 

PreRelease2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PreRelease2 is a subset of what will become the full 2.0
release. PreRelease1 included platform support for mica2 and sample
applications built using a new TinyOS component architecture
(OSKI). PreRelease2 expands supported platforms to TelosB and MicaZ
and their CC2420 radio. PreRelease2 also includes some Microcontroller
Power Management implementation (see TEP112) and additional support
for peripherals (serial communication, sensors, etc.).

Installation:
Please see doc/html/upgrade-tinyos.html for how to upgrade from a 1.x
environment to a 2.x environment. doc/html/upgrade-tinyos.html also
explains how to maintain 1.x and 2.x trees simultaneously.
