/**
 * This application sends a single active message broadcast if it has
 * address 0, and then starts a timer at 1Hz.  If it has any address 
 * other than 0, it starts a timer at 1 Hz upon receiving a broadcast 
 * message.  The idea is to have one base station with address 0 send 
 * out a broadacst message to synchronize itself with all receivers.  
 * All Leds from the base station and any receivers of the broadcast 
 * should blink together.
 
 * It uses the radio HIL component
 * <tt>ActiveMessageC</tt>, and its packets are AM type 240.
