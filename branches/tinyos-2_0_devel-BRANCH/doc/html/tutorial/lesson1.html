<div class="title">Lesson 1: Getting Started with TinyOS and nesC</div>
<div class="subtitle">Last updated 18 May 2005</div>

<p>This lesson introduces the basic concepts of the component model
used by TinyOS, and the nesC component syntax.

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>TinyOS is written in nesC, an extension of the C language designed
to support the resource-challenged embedded systems space.  nesC's
extensions support an efficient yet robust component model, and a
concurrency model based on run-to-completion tasks and interrupt
handlers. This lesson introduces the TinyOS/nesC component model, and
the next lesson introduces the TinyOS/nesC concurrency model.

<h2>Components and Interfaces</h2>

A nesC application consists of one or more <i>components</i>
assembled, or <i>wired</i>, to form an application executable.
Components define two scopes: one for their specification which
contains the names of their <i>interfaces</i>, and a second scope for their
implementation. A component <i>provides</i> and <i>uses</i>
interfaces. The provided interfaces are intended to represent
the functionality that the component provides to its user in its
specification; the used interfaces represent the functionality the
component needs to perform its job in its implementation.

<p>Interfaces are bidirectional: they specify a set of
<i>commands</i>, which are functions to be implemented by the
interface's provider, and a set of <i>events</i>, which are functions
to be implemented by the interface's user. For a component to call the
commands in an interface, it must implement the events of that
interface. A single component may use or provide multiple interfaces
and multiple instances of the same interface.

<p>The set of interfaces which a component provides together with the
set of interfaces that a component uses is considered that component's
<i>signature</i>.

<h2>Configurations and Modules</h2>

There are two types of components in nesC: <i>modules</i> and
<i>configurations</i>. Modules provide the implementations of one or more
interfaces. Configurations are used to assemble other components
together, connecting interfaces used by components to interfaces
provided by others. This is called <i>wiring</i>. Every nesC
application is described by a top-level configuration that wires
together the components inside.

<h1>Blink: An Example Application</h1>

<p>Let's look at concrete examples using the application Blink found
in <tt><a href="../../../apps/Blink">apps/Blink</a></tt> in the TinyOS
tree. This application simply causes the LED0 to to turn on and off at
.25Hz, LED1 to turn on and off at .5Hz, and LED2 to turn on and off at
1Hz.<a href="#leds_footnote">(1)</a> The effect is as if the three
LEDs were displaying a binary count of one to seven every two
seconds. </p>

<p>Blink is composed of two <b>components</b>: a <b>module</b>, called
"<tt>BlinkC.nc</tt>", and a <b>configuration</b>, called
"<tt>BlinkAppC.nc</tt>".  Remember that all applications require a
top-level configuration file, which is typically named after the
application itself. In this case <tt>BlinkApp.nc</tt> is the
configuration for the Blink application and the source file that the
nesC compiler uses to generate an executable file. <tt>BlinkC.nc</tt>,
on the other hand, actually provides the <i>implementation</i> of the
Blink application. As you might guess, <tt>BlinkAppC.nc</tt> is used
to wire the <tt>BlinkC.nc</tt> module to other components that the
Blink application requires. </p>

<p>The reason for the distinction between modules and configurations
is to allow a system designer to quickly "snap together"
applications. For example, a designer could provide a configuration
that simply wires together one or more modules, none of which she
actually designed.  Likewise, another developer can provide a new set
of "library" modules that can be used in a range of applications. </p>

<!-- Is this really the T2 convention? -->
<p>Sometimes (as is the case with <tt>BlinkAppC</tt> and
<tt>BlinkC</tt>) you will have a configuration and a module that go
together. When this is the case, the convention used in the TinyOS
source tree is:</p>


<table border="1"  cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1">
<tbody>

<tr>
<td>File Name </td>
<td>File Type </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><tt>Foo.nc</tt></td>
<td>Interface </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><tt>FooC.nc <a href="#hint9">(2)</a></tt></td>
<td>Public Module</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><tt>FooP.nc</tt></td>
<td>Private Module</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><tt>FooAppC.nc</tt> </td>
<td>Configuration</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

<p>While you could
name an application's implementation module and associated top-level
configuration anything, to keep things simple we suggest that you
adopt this convention in your own code. There are several other 
conventions used in TinyOS;  
<a href="../tep3.html">TEP 3</a>
specifies the coding standards and best current practices.

<h1>The BlinkAppC.nc Configuration</h1>

<p>The nesC compiler compiles a nesC application when given the file
containing the top-level configuration. Typical TinyOS applications
come with a standard Makefile that allows platform selection and
invokes ncc with appropriate options on the application's top-level
configuration.

<p>Let's look at <tt>BlinkAppC.nc</tt>, the configuration for this
application first:

<pre></pre>
<prehead>apps/Blink/BlinkAppC.nc:</prehead>
<pre>
configuration BlinkAppC {
}
implementation {  
  components MainC, BlinkC, LedsC;
  components new TimerMilliC() as Timer0;
  components new TimerMilliC() as Timer1;
  components new TimerMilliC() as Timer2;

  BlinkC -> MainC.Boot;
  MainC.SoftwareInit -> LedsC;
  BlinkC.Timer0 -> Timer0;
  BlinkC.Timer1 -> Timer1;
  BlinkC.Timer2 -> Timer2;
  BlinkC.Leds -> LedsC;
}
</pre>

<p>The first thing to notice is the key word <tt>configuration</tt>,
which indicates that this is a configuration file. The first two
lines,

<pre></pre>
<prehead>apps/Blink/BlinkAppC.nc:</prehead>
<pre>
configuration BlinkAppC {
}
</pre>

simply state that this is a configuration called <tt>BlinkAppC</tt>.
Within the empty braces here it is possible to specify <tt>uses</tt>
and <tt>provides</tt> clauses, as with a module. This is important to
keep in mind: a configuration can use and provide interfaces. Said
another way, not all configurations are top-level applications.

<p>The actual configuration is implemented within the pair of curly
brackets following the key word <tt>implementation </tt>. The
<tt>components</tt> lines specify the set of components that this
configuration references. In this case those components are
<tt>Main</tt>, <tt>BlinkC</tt>,
<tt>LedsC</tt>, and three instances of a timer component called
<tt>TimerMilliC</tt> which will be referenced as Timer0, Timer1,
and Timer2<a href="#oskitimermillic_footnote">(3)</a>. This is accomplished
via the <i>as</i> keyword which is simply an alias<a href="#hint10">(4)</a>. 

<p>As we continue reviewing the BlinkAppC application, keep in mind that the
BlinkAppC component is not the same as the BlinkC component. Rather,
the BlinkAppC component is composed of the BlinkC component along with
MainC and LedsC.

<p>The remainder of the BlinkAppC configuration consists of connecting
interfaces used by components to interfaces provided by others. The
<tt>MainC.Boot</tt> and <tt>MainC.SoftwareInit</tt> interfaces are
part of TinyOS's boot sequence and will be covered in detail in Lesson
3. Suffice it to say that these wirings enable the LEDs and Timers to
be initialized.

<p>The last four lines wire interfaces that the BlinkC component
<i>uses</i> to interfaces that the TimerMilliC and LedsC
components <i>provide</i>. To fully understand the semantics of these
wirings, it is helpful to look at the BlinkC module's definition and
implementation.

<h1>The BlinkC.nc Module</h1>

<pre></pre>
<prehead>apps/Blink/BlinkC.nc:</prehead>
<pre>
module BlinkC {
  uses interface Timer&lt;TMilli&gt; as Timer0;
  uses interface Timer&lt;TMilli&gt; as Timer1;
  uses interface Timer&lt;TMilli&gt; as Timer2;
  uses interface Leds;
  users interface Boot;
}
implementation
{
  // implementation code omitted
}
</pre>

<p>The first part of the module code states that this is a module
called <tt>BlinkC</tt>and declares the interfaces it provides and
uses.&nbsp; The <tt>BlinkC</tt>&nbsp; module <b>uses</b> three
instances of the interface <tt>Timer&lt;TMilli&gt;</tt> using the
names Timer0, Timer1 and Timer2 (the <tt>&lt;TMilli&gt;</tt> syntax
simply supplies the generic Timer component with the required timer
precision). Lastly, the <tt>BlinkC</tt>
module also uses the Leds and Boot interfaces. This means that BlinkC
may call any command declared in the interfaces it uses and must also
implement any events declared in those interfaces.

<p>After reviewing the interfaces used by the <tt>BlinkC</tt>
component, the semantics of the last four lines in
<tt>BlinkAppC.nc</tt> should become clearer.  The line
<tt>BlinkC.Timer0 -&gt; Timer0</tt> wires the three
<tt>Timer&lt;TMilli&gt;</tt> interface used by <tt>BlinkC</tt> to the
<tt>Timer&lt;TMilli&gt;</tt> interface provided the three
<tt>TimerMilliC</tt> component. The <tt>BlinkC.Leds -&gt;
LedsC</tt> line wires the <tt>Leds</tt> interface used by the
<tt>BlinkC</tt> component to the <tt>Leds</tt> interface provided by
the <tt>LedsC</tt> component.

<p>You may have surmised that nesC uses arrows to determine relationships
between interfaces.  Think of the right arrow (<tt>-&gt;</tt>) as
"binds to". The left side of the arrow binds an interface to an
implementation on the right side.  In other words, the component that
<b>uses</b> an interface is on the left, and the component <b>provides
</b>the interface is on the right. </p>

It follows, then, that on the line:

<pre></pre>
<prehead>apps/Blink/BlinkAppC.nc:</prehead>
<pre>
  BlinkC.Timer -> Timer0;
</pre>

<tt>BlinkC.Timer</tt> on the left side of the arrow is referring to
the <i>interface</i> called Timer (<tt>tos/lib/timer/Timer.nc</tt>),
while <tt>Timer0</tt> on the right side of the arrow is referring to
the <i>implementation </i>of Timer</tt>. Remember that the arrow
always binds interfaces (on the left) to implementations (on the
right).

<p><tt>BlinkAppC</tt> also illustrates that wirings can be
implicit. For example:

<pre></pre>
<prehead>apps/Blink/BlinkAppC.nc:</prehead>
<pre>
  BlinkC.Leds -> LedsC;
</pre>

is really shorthand for:

<pre>
  BlinkC.Leds -> LedsC.Leds;
</pre>

If no interface name is given on the right side of the arrow, the nesC
compiler by default tries to bind to the same interface as on the left
side of the arrow.

<h1>Exercise</h1>

<p>As a first exercise, simply compile the Blink application for your
chosen platform.  If you don't have hardware, you can compile for the 
<code>pc</code> platform which is simulated code.</p>

<p>The TinyOS makefile structure is tailored to ease 
adding new platforms with widely differing hardware support into TinyOS. 
The makefile system definitions are located in tinyos-2.x/support/make.

<p>The make command to compile a TinyOS application is 
<code>make</code>&nbsp;<i>[platform]</i> and should be executed from the 
application's directory. From the <code>apps/Blink</code> directory
you could enter the following to compile an image for the telosb platform:

<pre>
  make telosb
</pre>

<p>The make parameters that you use to upload or <i>install</i> your 
application image onto your mote vary from platform to platform. Please
check your hardware manufacturer's Getting Started Guide for exact parameters
(see <a href="#related_docs">Related Documentation</a>). In general,
however, the make command to install an image onto a mote is
<code>make</code>&nbsp;<i>[platform]</i>&nbsp
<code>install,</code><i>[moteid]</i>&nbsp;
<i>[upload port]</i>. From the <code>apps/Blink</code> directory
you could enter:

<pre>
$ motelist
Reference  CommPort   Description
---------- ---------- ----------------------------------------
UCC89MXV   COM4       Telos (Rev B 2004-09-27)
</pre>

<i>motelist</i> is a command that will tell you which ports have motes attached. In 
this case a TelosB mote is connected to COM port 4. Now you can install the application using:

<pre>
  make telosb install,2 bsl,3
</pre>

<p>This would compile an image suitable for the telosb platform and install 
it with a mote ID of 2 using the <code>tos-bsl</code> loader on 
COM port 4 (the bsl argument uses n-1 notation: the COM port is 4 but 
the argument on the make line is 3 (4-1)). Again, see the Getting Started 
Guide for your chosen platform for the exact make parameters.</p>

<p>You should see something like this scroll by:

<pre>
mkdir -p build/telosb
    compiling BlinkAppC to a telosb binary
ncc -o build/telosb/main.exe -Os -O -mdisable-hwmul -Wall -Wshadow -DDEF_TOS_AM_GROUP=0x7d -Wnesc-all -target=telosb -fnesc-cfile=build/telosb/app.c -board=   BlinkAppC.nc -lm 
    compiled BlinkToRadioAppC to build/telosb/main.exe
            2782 bytes in ROM
             61 bytes in RAM
msp430-objcopy --output-target=ihex build/telosb/main.exe build/telosb/main.ihex
    writing TOS image
tos-set-symbols --objcopy msp430-objcopy --objdump msp430-objdump --target ihex build/telosb/main.ihex build/telosb/main.ihex.out-2 TOS_NODE_ID=2 ActiveMessageAddressC$addr=2
    found mote on COM4 (using bsl,auto)
    installing telosb binary using bsl
tos-bsl --telosb -c 16 -r -e -I -p build/telosb/main.ihex.out-2
MSP430 Bootstrap Loader Version: 1.39-telos-8

2782 bytes programmed.
Reset device ...
rm -f build/telosb/main.exe.out-2 build/telosb/main.ihex.out-2
</pre>

<p>This assumes you're running Windows. Things are slightly different on Linux.
Instead of COM4 you'll find a numbered "file" in the /dev directory. The actual name of this file
varies from distribution to distribution and depends on how the motes are physically connected 
(i.e., via serial or USB).

<pre>
$ motelist
Reference  CommPort   Description
---------- ---------- ----------------------------------------
UCC89MXV   /dev/ttyUSB3 Telos (Rev B 2004-09-27)
</pre>

<p>You use the same command to install, except you don't substract 1. 
The ports are already numbered starting at 0.

<pre>
  make telosb install,2 bsl,3
</pre>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>This lesson has introduced the concepts of the TinyOS component
model: configurations, modules, interfaces and wiring.  The next
lesson continues our look at Blink to expand 1) on the nesC/TinyOS concurrency model
and 2) Module implementations.

<p><a name="leds_footnote">(1)</a> Unlike in tinyos-1.x, LEDs in 2.x
are not labeled by color but instead by number to reflect the fact
that different platforms have different colored LEDs. In telos, the
mapping (LED0,LED1,LED2) to (Red,Green,Blue), and in mica motes the
mapping is (LED0,LED1,LED2) to (Red,Green,Yellow).

<b>Programming Hint 9:</b> If a component is a usable abstraction by itself, 
its name should end with C. If it is intended to be an internal and private
