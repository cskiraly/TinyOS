communications and you will learn how to:

<p>

<ul>

<li>Use <code>message_t</code>, the TinyOS 2.0 message buffer.

<li>Send a message buffer to the radio.

<li>Receive a message buffer from the radio.
<!-- TODO add...
<li>Access metadata in a message buffer.
-->
</ul>


<h1>Introduction</h1>

TinyOS provides a number of <i>interfaces</i> to abstract the
underlying communications services and a number of <i>components</i>
that <i>provide</i> (implement) these interfaces.  All of these
interfaces and components use a common message buffer abstraction,
called <code>message_t</code>, which is implemented as a nesC struct
(similar to a C struct).  The <code>message_t</code> abstraction replaces
the TinyOS 1.x <code>TOS_Msg</code> abstraction.  Unlike TinyOS 1.x, the
members of <code>message_t</code> are opaque, and therefore not accessed
directly.  Rather, <code>message_t</code> is an
<i>abstract data type</i>, whose members are read and written using
accessor and mutator functions<a href="#fn1">(1)</a>.

<h2>Basic Communications Interfaces</h2>

<p>There are a number of interfaces and components that use
<code>message_t</code> as the underlying data structure.  Let's take a
look at some of the interfaces that are in the <code>tos/interfaces</code>
directory to familiarize ourselves with the general functionality of
the communications system:

<p>
<ul>

<li><code><a href="../../../tos/interfaces/Packet.nc">Packet</a></code> -
Provides the basic accessors for the <code>message_t</code> abstract data
type.  This interface provides commands for clearing a message's
contents, getting its payload length, and getting a pointer to its
payload area.

<li><code><a href="../../../tos/interfaces/Send.nc">Send</a></code> -
Provides the basic <i>address-free</i> message sending interface.
This interface provides commands for sending a message and canceling a
pending message send.  The interface provides an event to indicate
whether a message was sent successfully or not.  It also provides
convenience functions for getting the message's maximum payload as
well as a pointer to a message's payload area.

<li><code><a href="../../../tos/interfaces/Receive.nc">Receive</a></code>
- Provides the basic message reception interface.  This interface
provides an event for receiving messages.  It also provides, for
convenience, commands for getting a message's payload length and
getting a pointer to a message's payload area.

<li><code><a
href="../../../tos/interfaces/PacketAcknowledgements.nc">PacketAcknowledgements</a></code>
- Provides a mechanism for requesting acknowledgements on a per-packet
basis.

<li><code><a
href="../../../tos/interfaces/RadioTimeStamping.nc">RadioTimeStamping</a></code>
- Provides time stamping information for radio transmission and
reception.

</ul>

<h2>Active Message Interfaces</h2>

<p>Since it is very common to have multiple services using the same
radio to communicate, TinyOS provides the Active Message (AM) layer to
multiplex access to the radio.  The term "AM type" refers to the
field used for multiplexing.  AM types are similar in function to the
Ethernet frame type field, IP protocol field, and the UDP port in that
all of them are used to multiplex access to a communication service.
AM packets also includes a destination field, which stores an
"AM address"  to address packets to particular motes. Additional 
interfaces, also located in the <code>tos/interfaces</code> directory, 
were introduced to support the AM services:

<p>
<ul>

<li><code><a
href="../../../tos/interfaces/AMPacket.nc">AMPacket</a></code> - Similar
to <code>Packet</code>, provides the basic AM accessors for the
<code>message_t</code> abstract data type.  This interface provides
commands for getting a node's AM address, an AM packet's destination,
and an AM packet's type.  Commands are also provides for setting an AM
packet's destination and type, and checking whether the destination is
the local node.

<li><code><a href="../../../tos/interfaces/AMSend.nc">AMSend</a></code> -
Similar to <code>Send</code>, provides the basic Active Message sending
interface.  The key difference between <code>AMSend</code> and
<code>Send</code> is that <code>AMSend</code> takes a destination AM address in its
<code>send</code> command.

</ul>

<p>
The AM address of a node can be set at installation time, using the
<code>make install.<i>n</i></code> or <code>make reinstall.<i>n</i></code>
commands. It can be changed at runtime using the
<code>ActiveMessageAddressC</code> component (see below).  </ul>

<h2>Components</h2>

<p>A number of components implement the basic communications and
active message interfaces.  Let's take a look at some of the
components in the <code>/tos/system</code> directory.  You should be
familiar with these components because your code needs to specify both
the <i>interfaces</i> your application
<i>uses</i> as well as the <i>components</i> which <i>provide</i>
(implement) those interfaces:

<p>
<ul>

<li><code><a
href="../../../tos/system/AMReceiverC.nc">AMReceiverC</a></code> -
Provides the following interfaces: <code>Receive</code>, <code>Packet</code>,
and <code>AMPacket</code>.

<li><code><a href="../../../tos/system/AMSenderC.nc">AMSenderC</a></code>
- Provides <code>AMSend</code>, <code>Packet</code>, <code>AMPacket</code>, and
<code>PacketAcknowledgements</code> as <code>Acks</code>.

<li><code><a href="../../../tos/system/AMSnooperC.nc">AMSnooperC</a></code>
- Provides <code>Receive</code>, <code>Packet</code>, and <code>AMPacket</code>.

<li><code><a
href="../../../tos/system/AMSnoopingReceiverC.nc">AMSnoopingReceiverC</a></code>
- Provides <code>Receive</code>, <code>Packet</code>, and <code>AMPacket</code>.

<li><code><a
href="../../../tos/system/ActiveMessageAddressC.nc">ActiveMessageAddressC</a></code>
- Provides commands to get and set the node's active message address.
This interface is not for general use and changing the a node's active
message address can break the network stack, so avoid using it unless
you know what you are doing.

</ul>

<h2>Naming Wrappers</h2>

<p>Since TinyOS supports multiple platforms, each of which might have
their own implementation of the radio drivers, an additional,
platform-specific, naming wrapper called <code>ActiveMessageC</code> is
used to bridge these interfaces to their underlying, platform-specific
implementations.  <code>ActiveMessageC</code> provides most of the
communication interfaces presented above.  Platform-specific versions
of <code>ActiveMessageC</code>, as well the underlying implementations
which may be shared by multiple platforms (e.g. Telos and MicaZ)
include:

<p>

<ul>

<li><code>ActiveMessageC</code> for the <a
href="../../../tos/platforms/eyesIFX/ActiveMessageC.nc">eyesIFX</a>
platform is implemented by <code><a
href="../../../tos/chips/tda5250/Tda5250ActiveMessageC.nc">Tda5250ActiveMessageC</a></code>.

<li><code>ActiveMessageC</code> for the 
<a href="../../../tos/platforms/intelmote2/ActiveMessageC.nc">intelmote2</a>,
<a href="../../../tos/platforms/micaz/ActiveMessageC.nc">micaz</a>,
<a href="../../../tos/platforms/telosa/ActiveMessageC.nc">telosa</a>, and
<a href="../../../tos/platforms/telosa/ActiveMessageC.nc">telosb</a>
are all implemented by 
<code><a
href="../../../tos/chips/cc2420/CC2420ActiveMessageC.nc">CC2420ActiveMessageC</a></code>.

<li><code>ActiveMessageC</code> for the <a
href="../../../tos/platforms/mica2/ActiveMessageC.nc">mica2</a>
platform is implemented by <code><a
href="../../../tos/chips/cc1000/CC1000ActiveMessageC.nc">CC1000ActiveMessageC</a></code>.

</ul>

<h1>The TinyOS 2.0 Message Buffer</h1>

<p>TinyOS 2.0 introduces a new message buffer abstraction called
<code>message_t</code>.  If you are familiar with earlier versions of
TinyOS, you need to know that <code>message_t</code> replaces 
<code>TOS_Msg</code>.  The <code>message_t</code> structure is defined in
<code><a
href="../../../tos/types/message.h">tos/types/message.h</a></code>.

<pre>
typedef nx_struct message_t {
  nx_uint8_t header[sizeof(message_header_t)];
  nx_uint8_t data[TOSH_DATA_LENGTH];
  nx_uint8_t footer[sizeof(message_header_t)];
  nx_uint8_t metadata[sizeof(message_metadata_t)];
} message_t;
</pre>

<p><b>Note: The header, footer, and metadata fields are all opaque and
must not be accessed directly.  It is important to access the
<code>message_t</code> fields only through <code>Packet</code>,
<code>AMPacket</code>, and other such interfaces, as will be demonstrated
in this tutorial.</b> The rationale for this approach is that it allows
the data (payload) to be kept at a fixed offset, avoiding a copy when
a message is passed between two link layers. See
Section 3 in <a href="#fn1">TEP 111</a>  for more details.

<h1>Sending a Message over the Radio</h1>

We will now create a simple application that increments a counter, displays
the counter's three least significant bits on the three LEDs, and sends a
message with the counter value over the radio.  Our implementation will use
a single timer and a counter, in a way similar to the
<code>BlinkSingle</code> example from <a href="lesson2.html">lesson 2</a>.

<h2>Reimplementing Blink</h2>

As a first step, we can reimplement <code>Blink</code> using a single
timer and counter.  Create a new directory in <tt>apps</tt> named
<tt>BlinkToRadio</tt>:

<pre>
$ cd tinyos-2.x/apps
$ mkdir BlinkToRadio
</pre>

Inside this directory, create a file <code>BlinkToRadioC.nc</code>, which
has this code: 

<pre>
#include &lt;Timer.h&gt;
#include "BlinkToRadio.h"

module BlinkToRadioC {
  uses interface Boot;
  uses interface Leds;
  uses interface Timer&lt;TMilli&gt; as Timer0;
}
implementation {
  uint16_t counter = 0;

  event void Boot.booted() {
    call Timer0.startPeriodic(TIMER_PERIOD_MILLI);
  }

  event void Timer0.fired() {
    counter++;
    call Leds.set(counter);
  }
}

</pre>

<p>Let's look at a few specific lines in this program.  First, notice
the C preprocessor <code>include</code> directive on the first line.  This
directive tells the compiler to simply replace the directive with the
entire contents of <code>Timer.h</code>.  The compiler looks for
<code>Timer.h</code> in the <i>standard</i> places.  In this case,
standard means the TinyOS system directories that are located in
<code>tos</code> or its subdirectories.  It is possible to tell the
compiler to look beyond these standard directories by using the
<code>-I</code> flag in the Makefile, for example, as is common when
including contributed libraries located in <code>contrib</code> directory
tree.

<p>The second line of this program is also an <code>include</code>
directive, but note that it uses quotes around the filename rather
than angle brackets.  The quotes tell the preprocessor to look in the
current directory before searching through the standard directories
for the particular file.  In this case, the <code>BlinkToRadio.h</code>
file is located in the same directory and defines some constants that
are used in this program.  We will take a look at
<code>BlinkToRadio.h</code> in just a bit.

<p>Next, the call to <code>Leds.set</code> directly sets the three LEDs to 
the three low-order bits of the counter.

<p>Finally, note the <code>call
Timer0.startPeriodic(TIMER_PERIOD_MILLI)</code> line in the
<code>Boot.booted</code> function.  The value of
<code>TIMER_PERIOD_MILLI</code> is defined in the <code>BlinkToRadio.h</code>
header file:

<pre>
#ifndef BLINKTORADIO_H
#define BLINKTORADIO_H

enum {
  TIMER_PERIOD_MILLI = 250
};

#endif
</pre>

<p><code>BlinkToRadio.h</code> is a pretty standard header file but there
are two things to note here.  First, notice the use of the
<code>ifndef</code>, <code>define</code>, and <code>endif</code> directives.
These directives are used to ensure that the definitions in each
header file is not included multiple times because the compiler would
complain about multiply-defined objects.  By convention, the literal
used for these directives is an all-caps version of the filename with
any periods converted to underscores.  The other important thing to
note is the use of an <code>enum</code> declaration for defining the
constant <code>TIMER_PERIOD_MILLI</code>.  Using <code>enum</code> for
defining constants is preferred over using <code>define</code> because
<code>enum</code> does not indiscriminantly replace every occurence of the
<code>define</code>d literal, regardless of where it appears in the
source.  As a result, <code>enum</code>s provide better scoping as well.

<p><code>BlinkToRadioC.nc</code> provides the <i>implementation</i> logic
of the program and <code>BlinkToRadio.h</code> defines constants and/or
data structures.  A third file is needed to <i>wire</i> the interfaces
that the implementation <code>uses</code> to the actual components which
<code>provide</code> these interfaces.  The <code>BlinkToRadioAppC.nc</code>
provides the needed wiring:

<pre>
#include &lt;Timer.h&gt;
#include "BlinkToRadio.h"

configuration BlinkToRadioAppC {
}
implementation {
  components MainC;
  components LedsC;
  components BlinkToRadioC as App;
  components new TimerMilliC() as Timer0;

  App.Boot -> MainC;
  App.Leds -> LedsC;
  App.Timer0 -> Timer0;
}
</pre>

<p>The <code>BlinkToRadioAppC</code> should look familiar to you since it is
essentially a subset of the <code>Blink</code> application/configuration
from an earlier lesson.</p>

<p>These three files constitute all of the application code: the only other
thing it needs is a Makefile. Create a file named <code>Makefile</code>. For
an application as simple as this one, the Makefile is very short:</p>

<pre>
COMPONENT=BlinkToRadioAppC
include $(MAKERULES)

</pre>

<p>The first line tells the TinyOS make system that the top-level
application component is BlinkToRadioAppC. The second line 
loads in the TinyOS build system, which has all of the rules
for building and installing on different platforms.</p>

<h2>Defining a Message Structure</h2>

<p>Now that <code>Blink</code> has been reimplemented using a single timer
and counter, we can now turn our attention to defining a message
format to send data over the radio.  Our message will send both the
node id and the counter value over the radio.  Rather than directly
writing and reading the payload area of the <code>message_t</code> with
this data, we will use a structure to hold them and then use structure
assignment to copy the data into the message payload area.  Using a
structure allows reading and writing the message payload more
conveniently when your message has multiple fields or multi-byte fields
(like uint16_t or uint32_t) because you can avoid reading and writing
bytes from/to the payload using indices and then shifting and adding
(e.g. <code>uint16_t x = data[0] << 8 + data[1]</code>).  Even for a
message with a single field, you should get used to using a structure
because if you ever add more fields to your message or move any of the
fields around, you will need to manually update all of the payload
position indices if you read and write the payload at a byte level.
Using structures is straightforward.  To define a message structure
with a <code>uint16_t</code> node id and a <code>uint16_t</code> counter in
the payload, we add the following lines to <code>BlinkToRadio.h</code>,
just before the <code>endif</code> directive:

<pre>
typedef nx_struct BlinkToRadioMsg {
  nx_uint16_t nodeid;
  nx_uint16_t counter;
} BlinkToRadioMsg;
</pre>

<p>If this code doesn't look even vaguely familiar, you should spend a
few minutes reading up on C structures. If you are familiar with C
structures, this syntax should look familar but the <code>nx_</code>
prefix on the keywords <code>struct</code> and <code>uint16_t</code> should
stand out.  The <code>nx_</code> prefix is specific to the nesC language
and signifies that the <code>struct</code> and <code>uint16_t</code> are
<i>external types</i><a href="#hint15">(3)</a><a href="#hint16">(4)</a>.
External types have the same representation on all platforms.
 The nesC compiler generates code that transparently reorders access to 
 <code>nx_</code> data types and eliminates the need to manually address 
endianness and alignment (extra padding in structs present on some
platforms) issues. So what is endianness?  Read on...

<p>Different processors represent numbers in different ways in their
memory: some processors use a "big endian" representation which
means that the most significant byte of a multi-byte (e.g. 16- or
32-bit) number is located at a lower memory address than the least
significant byte, while "little endian" stores data in exactly the
opposite order.  A problem arises when data is serialized and sent
over the network because different processors will decode the same set
of bytes in different ways, depending on their "endianness."  The
main difficulty endiannes presents is that it requires operations to
rearrange byte orders to match the network protocol specification or
the processor architecture -- an annoying and error-prone process.
The <code>htons</code>, <code>htonl</code>, <code>ntohs</code>, and <code>ntohl</code>
calls used with the sockets API are an example of platform-specific
calls that convert between network and host byte orders, but you have
to remember to use them.  The nesC programming language takes a
different approach to the problem and defines
<i>external types</i> which allow the programmer to avoid dealing with byte
reordering.


<h2>Sending a Message</h2>

<p>Now that we have defined a message type for our application,
<code>BlinkToRadioMsg</code>, we will next see how to send the message
over the radio.  Before beginning, let's review the purpose of the
application.  We want a timer-driven system in which every firing of
the timer results in (i) incrementing a counter, (ii) displaying the
three lowest bits of the counter on the LEDs, and (iii) transmitting
the node's id and counter value over the radio.  To implement this
program, we follow a number of simple steps, as described in the next
paragraph.

<p>First, we need to identify the interfaces (and components) that
provide access to the radio and allow us to manipulate the
<code>message_t</code> type.  Second, we must update the <code>module</code>
block in the <code>BlinkToRadioC.nc</code> by adding <code>uses</code>
statements for the interfaces we need.  Third, we need to declare 
new variables and add any initialization and start/stop code that is
needed by the interfaces and components.  Fourth, we must add any
calls to the component interfaces we need for our application.  Fifth,
we need to implmement any events specified in the interfaces we plan
on using.  Sixth, the <code>implementation</code> block of the application
configuration file, <code>BlinkToRadioApp.c</code>, must be updated by
adding a <code>components</code> statement for each component we use that
provides one of the interfaces we chose earlier.  Finally, we need to
wire the the interfaces used by the application to the components
which provide those interfaces.

<p>Let's walk through the steps, one-by-one: 

<ol>

<p><li><b>Identify the interfaces (and components) that provide access
to the radio and allow us to manipulate the <code>message_t</code>
type.</b> 

<p>We will use the <code>AMSend</code> interface to send packets as
well as the <code>Packet</code> and <code>AMPacket</code> interfaces to access
the <code>message_t</code> abstract data type.  Although it is possible to
wire directly to the <code>ActiveMessageC</code> component, we will
instead use the <code>AMSenderC</code> component.  However, we still need
to start the radio using the <code>ActiveMessageC.SplitControl</code>
interface.

<p>The reason for using <code>AMSenderC</code> is because it provides a
virtualized abstraction.  Earlier versions of TinyOS did not
virtualize access to the radio, so it was possible for two components
that were sharing the radio to interfere with each other.  It was not
at all uncommon for one component to discover the radio was busy
because some other component, unknown to the first component, was
accessing the active message layer.  Radio virtualization was
introduced in TinyOS 2.0 to address this interference and
<code>AMSenderC</code> was written to provide this virtualization.  Every
user of <code>AMSenderC</code> is provided with a 1-deep queue and
the queues of all users are serviced in a fair manner.

<p><li><b>Update the <code>module</code> block in the
<code>BlinkToRadioC.nc</code> by adding <code>uses</code> statements for the
interfaces we need:</b>

<pre>
module BlinkToRadioC {
  ...
  uses interface Packet;
  uses interface AMPacket;
  uses interface AMSend;
  uses interface SplitControl as AMControl;
}
</pre>

Note that <code>SplitControl</code> has been renamed to <code>AMControl</code>
using the <code>as</code> keyword.  nesC allows interfaces to be renamed
in this way for several reasons.  First, it often happens
that two or more components that are needed in the same module provide the
same interface.  The <code>as</code> keyword allows one or more such names
to be changed to distinct names so that they can each be addressed
individually.  Second, interfaces are sometimes renamed to something
more meaningful.  In our case, <code>SplitControl</code> is a general
interface used for starting and stopping components, but the name
<code>AMControl</code> is a mnemonic to remind us that the particular
instance of <code>SplitControl</code> is used to control the
<code>ActiveMessageC</code> component.


<p><li><b>Declare any new variables and add any needed initialization
code.</b>

<p>First, we need to declare some new module-scope variables.  We need a
<code>message_t</code> to hold our data for transmission.  We also need a
flag to keep track of when the radio is busy sending.  These
declarations need to be added in the <code>implementation</code> block of
<code>BlinkToRadioC.nc</code>:

<pre>
implementation {
  bool busy = FALSE;
  message_t packet;
  ...
}
</pre>

<p>Next, we need to handle the initialization of the radio.  The radio
needs to be started when the system is booted so we must call
<code>AMControl.start</code> inside <code>Boot.booted</code>.  The only
complication is that in our current implementation, we start a timer
inside <code>Boot.booted</code> and we are planning to use this timer to
send messages over the radio but the radio can't be used until it has
completed starting up.  The radio signals that it has completed
starting through the <code>AMControl.startDone</code> event.  To ensure
that we do not start using the radio before it is ready, we need to
postpone starting the timer until after the radio has completed
starting.  We can accomplish this by moving the call to start the
timer, which is now inside <code>Boot.booted</code>, to
<code>AMControl.startDone</code>, giving us a new <code>Boot.booted</code> with
the following body:

<pre>
  event void Boot.booted() {
    call AMControl.start();
  }
</pre>

<p>We also need to implement the <code>AMControl.startDone</code> event
handler, which has the following body:

<pre>
  event void AMControl.startDone(error_t err) {
    if (err == SUCCESS) {
      call Timer0.startPeriodic(TIMER_PERIOD_MILLI);
    }
    else {
      call AMControl.start();
    }
  }
</pre>

<p>If the radio is started successfully, <code>AMControl.startDone</code>
will be called with the <code>error_t</code> parameter set to a value of
<code>SUCCESS</code>.  If the radio starts successfully, then it is
appropriate to start the timer.  If, however, the radio does not start
successfully, then it obviously cannot be used so we try again to
start it.  This process continues until the radio starts, and ensures
that the node software doesn't run until the key components have
started successfully.  If the radio doesn't start at all, a human
operator might notice that the LEDs are not blinking as they are
supposed to, and might try to debug the problem.


<p><li><b>Add any program logic and calls to the used interfaces we
need for our application.</b> 

<p>Since we want to transmit the node's id and counter value every
time the timer fires, we need to add some code to the
<code>Timer0.fired</code> event handler:

<pre>
event void Timer0.fired() {
  ...
  if (!busy) {
    BlinkToRadioMsg* btrpkt = (BlinkToRadioMsg*)(call Packet.getPayload(&amp;pkt, NULL));
    btrpkt->nodeid = TOS_NODE_ID;
    btrpkt->counter = counter;
    if (call AMSend.send(AM_BROADCAST_ADDR, &amp;pkt, sizeof(BlinkToRadioMsg)) == SUCCESS) {
      busy = TRUE;
    }
  }
}
</pre>

This code performs several operations.  First, it ensures that a message
transmission is not in progress by checking the busy flag. Then it
gets the packet's payload portion and casts it to a pointer to the
previously declared <code>BlinkToRadioMsg</code> external type. It can
now use this pointer to initialise the packet's fields, and then send
the packet by calling <code>AMSend.send</code>. The packet is sent to all 
nodes in radio range by specyfing <code>AM_BROADCAST_ADDR</code> as the
destination address. Finally, the test against SUCCESS verifies that the
AM layer accepted the message for transmission. If so, the busy flag is set 
to true. For the duration of the send attempt, the packet is owned by the
radio, and user code must not access it.

<p>Note that we could have avoided using the <code>Packet</code> interface,
as it's <code>getPayload</code> command is repeated within <code>AMSend</code>.


<p><li><b>Implmement any (non-initialization) events specified in the
interfaces we plan on using.</b> 

<p>Looking through the <code>Packet</code>,
<code>AMPacket</code>, and <code>AMSend</code> interfaces, we see that there
is only one <code>event</code> we need to worry about,
<code>AMSend.sendDone</code>:

<pre>
  /** 
   * Signaled in response to an accepted send request. msg is
   * the message buffer sent, and error indicates whether
   * the send was successful.
   *
   * @param  msg   the packet which was submitted as a send request
   * @param  error SUCCESS if it was sent successfully, FAIL if it was not,
   *               ECANCEL if it was cancelled
   * @see send
   * @see cancel
   */ 
  event void sendDone(message_t* msg, error_t error);
</pre>

This event is signaled after a message transmission attempt.  In
addition to signaling whether the message was transmitted successfully
or not, the event also returns ownership of <code>msg</code> from
<code>AMSend</code> back to the component that originally called the
<code>AMSend.send</code> command.  Therefore <code>sendDone</code> handler
needs to clear the <code>busy</code> flag to indicate that the message
buffer can be reused:

<pre>
  event void AMSend.sendDone(message_t* msg, error_t error) {
    if (&amp;pkt == msg) {
      busy = FALSE;
    }
  }
</pre>

Note the check to ensure the message buffer that was signaled is the
same as the local message buffer.  This test is needed because if two
components wire to the same <code>AMSend</code>, <i>both</i> will receive
a <code>sendDone</code> event after <i>either</i> component issues a
<code>send</code> command.  Since a component writer has no way to enforce
that her component will not be used in this manner, a defensive style
of programming that verifies that the sent message is the same one
that is being signaled is required.


<p><li><b>Update the <code>implementation</code> block of the application
configuration file by adding a <code>components</code> statement for each
component used that provides one of the interfaces chosen earlier.</b>

<p>The following lines can be added just below the existing
<code>components</code> declarations in the <code>implementation</code> block
of <code>BlinkToRadioAppC.nc</code>:

<pre>
implementation {
  ...
  components ActiveMessageC;
  components new AMSenderC(AM_BLINKTORADIO);
  ...
}
</pre>

These statements indicate that two components, <code>ActiveMessageC</code>
and <code>AMSenderC</code>, will provide the needed interfaces.  However,
note the slight difference in their syntax.  <code>ActiveMessageC</code>
is a singleton component that is defined once for each type of
hardware platform.  <code>AMSenderC</code> is a generic, parameterized
component.  The <code>new</code> keyword indicates that a new instance of
<code>AMSenderC</code> will be created.  The <code>AM_BLINKTORADIO</code>
parameter indicates the AM type of the <code>AMSenderC</code>.  We can
extend the <code>enum</code> in the <code>BlinkToRadio.h</code> header file to
incorporate the value of <code>AM_BLINKTORADIO</code>:

<pre>
...
enum {
  AM_BLINKTORADIO = 6,
  TIMER_PERIOD_MILLI = 250
};
...
</pre>


<p><li><b>Wire the the interfaces used by the application to the
components which provide those interfaces.</b> 

<p>The following lines
will wire the used interfaces to the providing components.  These
lines should be added to the bottom of the <code>implementation</code>
block of <code>BlinkToRadioAppC.nc</code>:

<pre>

<h1>Receiving a Message over the Radio</h1>

<p>Now that we have an application that is transmitting messages, we
can add some code to receive and process the messages.  Let's write
code that, upon receiving a message, sets the LEDs to the three least
significant bits of the counter in the message.  To make this
application interesting, we will want to remove the line
<code><strike>call Leds.set(counter);</strike></code> from the
<code>Timer0.fired</code> event handler.  Otherwise, both the timer events
and packet receptions will update the LEDs and the resulting effect
will be bizarre.

<p>If two motes are programmed with our modified application, then
each will display the other mote's counter value.  If the motes go out
of radio range, then the LEDs will stop changing.  You can even
investigate link asymmetry by trying to get one mote's LEDs to keep
blinking while the other mote's LEDs stop blinking.  This would
indicate that the link from the non-blinking mote to blinking mote was
available but that the reverse channel was no longer available.

<ol>

<p><li><b>Identify the interfaces (and components) that provide access
to the radio and allow us to manipulate the <code>message_t</code>
type.</b> <p>We will use the <code>Receive</code> interface to receive
packets.

<p><li><b>Update the module block in the BlinkToRadioC.nc by adding
uses statements for the interfaces we need:</b>

<pre>
module BlinkToRadioC {
  ...
  uses interface Receive;
}
</pre>

<p><li><b>Declare any new variables and add any needed initialization
code.</b> <p> We will not require any new variables to receive and process
messages from the radio.

<p><li><b>Add any program logic and calls to the used interfaces we
need for our application.</b> <p> Message reception is an event-driven
process so we do not need to call cny commands on the
<code>Receive</code>.

<p><li><b>Implemement any (non-initialization) events specified in the
interfaces we plan on using.</b> <p>We need to implement the
<code>Receive.receive</code> event handler:

<pre>
event message_t* Receive.receive(message_t* msg, void* payload, uint8_t len) {
  if (len == sizeof(BlinkToRadioMsg)) {
    BlinkToRadioMsg* btrmsg = (BlinkToRadioMsg*)payload;
    call Leds.set(btrpkt->counter);
  }
  return msg;
}
</pre>

<p>The <code>receive</code> event handler performs some simple operations.
First, we need to ensure that the length of the message is what is
expected.  Then, the message payload is cast to a structure pointer of
type <code>BlinkToRadioMsg*</code> and assigned to a local variable.
Then, the counter value in the message is used to set the states of
the three LEDs.

<p>Note that we can safely manipulate the <code>counter</code> variable
outside of an atomic section.  The reason is that <rr>receive</code>
event executes in task context rather than interrupt context (events
that have the <code>async</code> keyword can execute in interrupt
context).  Since the TinyOS execution model allows only one task to
execute at a time, if all accesses to a variable occur in task
context, then no race conditions will occur for that variable.  Since
all accesses to <code>counter</code> occur in task context, no critical
sections are needed when accessing it.

<p><li><b>Update the implementation block of the application
configuration file by adding a components statement for each component
used that provides one of the interfaces chosen earlier.</b> <p>The
following lines can be added just below the existing
<code>components</code> declarations in the implementation block of
<code>BlinkToRadioAppsC.nc</code>:

<pre>
implementation {
  ...
  components new AMReceiverC(AM_BLINKTORADIO);
  ...
}
</pre>

This statement means that a new instance of <code>AMReceiverC</code> will
be created.  <code>AMReceiver</code> is a generic, parameterized
component. The <code>new</code> keyword indicates that a new instance of
<code>AMReceiverC</code> will be created. The <code>AM_BLINKTORADIO</code>
parameter indicates the AM type of the <code>AMReceiverC</code> and is
chosen to be the same as that used for the <code>AMSenderC</code> used
earlier, which ensures that the same AM type is being used for both
transmissions and receptions.  <code>AM_BLINKTORADIO</code> is defined in
the <code>BlinkToRadio.h</code> header file.

<p><li><b>Wire the the interfaces used by the application to the
components which provide those interfaces.</b> <p>Update the wiring by
insert the following line just before the closing brace of the
<code>implementation</code> block in BlinkToRadioAppC:

<pre>
implementation {
  ...
  App.Receive -> AMReceiverC;
}
</pre>

<p><li><b>Test your application!</b><p> Testing your application is easy.
Get two motes.  They can be mica2, micaz, telosa, telosb, or tmote.
For this exercise, let's assume that the motes are telosb (if not,
skip past the motelist part and program the mote using whatever the
appropriate programmer parameters are for your hardware).  Assuming
you are using a telosb, first open a Cygwin or Linux shell and cd to
the <code>apps/tutorials/BlinkToRadio</code> directory.  Then, insert the
first telosb mote into an available USB port on the PC and type
<code>motelist</code> the at the Cygwin or Linux prompt ($).  You should
see exactly one mote listed.  For example:

<pre>
$ motelist
Reference  CommPort   Description
---------- ---------- ----------------------------------------
UCC89MXV   COM17      Telos (Rev B 2004-09-27)
</pre>

<p>Now, assuming you are in the <code>apps/tutorials/BlinkToRadio</code>
directory, type <code>make telosb install,1</code>.  You should see a lot
text scroll by that looks something like:

<pre>
$ make telosb install,1
mkdir -p build/telosb
    compiling BlinkToRadioAppC to a telosb binary
ncc -o build/telosb/main.exe -Os -O -mdisable-hwmul -Wall -Wshadow -DDEF_TOS_AM_GROUP=0x7d -Wnesc-all -target=telosb -fnesc-cfile=build/telosb/app.c -board=   BlinkToRadioAppC.nc -lm 
    compiled BlinkToRadioAppC to build/telosb/main.exe

    found mote on COM17 (using bsl,auto)

rm -f build/telosb/main.exe.out-1 build/telosb/main.ihex.out-1 
</pre>

<p>Now, remove the first telosb from the USB port, insert the
batteries, and set it aside.  Insert the second telos into the USB
port and once again type <code>motelist</code>.  You should again see
something like:

<pre>
$ motelist
Reference  CommPort   Description
---------- ---------- ----------------------------------------
UC9VN03I   COM14      Telos (Rev B 2004-09-27)
</pre>

<p>Finally, type <code>make telosb reinstall,2</code> and you should once
again see something like the following scroll by:

<pre>
$ make telosb reinstall,2
tos-set-symbols --objcopy msp430-objcopy --objdump msp430-objdump --target ihex build/telosb/main.ihex build/telosb/main.ihex.out-2 TOS_NODE_ID=2 ActiveMessageAddressC$addr=2
    found mote on COM14 (using bsl,auto)
    installing telosb binary using bsl
tos-bsl --telosb -c 13 -r -e -I -p build/telosb/main.ihex.out-2
MSP430 Bootstrap Loader Version: 1.39-telos-8

9072 bytes programmed.
Reset device ...
rm -f build/telosb/main.exe.out-2 build/telosb/main.ihex.out-2 
</pre>

<b><font color="red">At this point, both motes should be blinking
their LEDs.</font></b> If you press the RESET button on either telosb,
then the LEDs on the <i>other</i> telosb will pause on whatever was
being displayed at the moment you pressed RESET.  When you release the
RESET the button, the paused mote will be reset and then resume
counting from one.
