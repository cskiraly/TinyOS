/**
 * A generic status controller that follows an OR rule. The controller
 * provides access to the power/activity state of an underlying shared
 * service and coordinates the requirements of all of the services's
 * clients. It follows the rule that if any client needs the service
 * to be active (through the Service.start() command), then it turns on
 * the service, or keeps it on. However, if no clients need the service
 * to be active (have all called stop() or not called start()), then
 * it turns it off. start() and stop() are both idempotent operations:
 * a client calling Service.start() twice has the same effect as
 * calling it once.
 *
 * The controller operates by keeping track of the state of all of its
 * clients (active or not) and managing the underlying component
 * appropriately with the SplitControl interface. The controller
 * assumes that only one SplitControl command can be in progress at
 * any time: if a state change occurs while the controller is
 * in the middle of a split phase call, it delays the action until
 * the completion of the call.
 *
 * If SplitControl calls to the underlying service fail, then the
 * controller silently fails. For example, if a client calls
 * Service.start() such that the underlying service should be started
 * (before this, all clients were inactive), then the controller will
 * call SplitControl.start(). The controller needs to keep track of
 * whether the service is active in case the call to
 * SplitControl.start() fails. If that happens, then the client's bit
 * will be set, but status.active will be FALSE. The ServiceController
 * maintains no timers; whenever an call or signal is made to the
 * controller, it modifies the corresponding state and checks if it
 * needs to enact a state change on the underlying service
 * (enactStateChange()). So in the case when a call to SplitControl
 * fails, the controller will not try to rectify the situation until
 * the next time it is called or signalled.
