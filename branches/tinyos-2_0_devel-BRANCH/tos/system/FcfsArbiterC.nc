/**
 * Please refer to TEP 108 for more information about this component and its
 * intended use.<br><br>
 *
 * This component provides the Resource, ArbiterInfo, and Resource Controller
 * interfaces and uses the ResourceConfigure interface as described in TEP 108.
 * It provides arbitration to a shared resource in an FCFS fashion.  An array
 * is used to keep track of which users have put in requests for the resource.
 * Upon the release of the resource by one of these users, the array is checked
 * and the next user (in FCFS order) that has a pending request
 * will ge granted control of the resource.  If there are no pending requests, then
 * the resource becomes idle and any user can put in a request and immediately receive
 * access to the Resource.
 *
