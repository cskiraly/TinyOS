  /**
  * TestPriorityArbiter Application
  * This application is used to test the functionality of the FcfsPriorityArbiter
  * component developed using the Resource and ResourceUser interfaces.
  * <br>
  * In this test there are 4 users of one ressource. The Leds indicate which
  * user is the owner of the resource:<br>
  * <li> normal priority client 1  - led 0
  * <li> normal priority client 2  - led 1
  * <li> power manager             - led 2
  * <li> high priority client      - led 0 and led 1 and led 2
  * <br><br>
  * The short flashing of the according leds inidicate that a user has requested the
  * resource. The users have the following behaviour:<br><br>
  * <li> Normal priority clients are idle for a period of time before requesting the resource.
  *      If they are granted the resource they will use it for a specific amount of time before releasing it.
  * <li> Power manager only request the resource if its idle. It releases the resource immediatly
  *       if there is a request from another client.
  * <li> High priority client behaves like a normal client but it will release the resource
  *      after a shorter period of time if there are requests from other clients.
  * <br><br>
  * The poliy of the arbiter should be FirstComeFirstServed with one exception:
  * If the high priority client requests the resource, the resource will be granted to the
  * high priority client after the release of the current owner regardless of the internal queue of the arbiter. After
  * the high priority client releases the resource the normal FCFS arbitration resumes.
