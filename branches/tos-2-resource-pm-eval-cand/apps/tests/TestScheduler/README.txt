TestScheduler is a simple test application for a Scheduler's implementation
of the TaskBasic interface. The application has three tasks, each of
which toggles a different LED after a brief spin loop.

This application has little (if any) use to a TinyOS user; it is intended
to be a basic sanity test for schedulers.
