README for TestTimer, 4/9/07 
Author/Contact: tinyos-help@millennium.berkeley.edu

Description:

This application tests TinyOS millisecond timers (TimerMilliC). It is
intended for use with TOSSIM, to test whether the timer implementation
is working correctly: its output consists of TOSSIM dbg() statements.
The relevant output channel is "TestTimer".

To test this application, compile for TOSSIM ('make micaz sim') and run
script.py ('python script.py'). If the TOSSIM timers are operating
correctly, then the output should say that timers are good, e.g.:

DEBUG (0): Timer A is good @ 0:9:56.837925167.
DEBUG (0): Timer B is good @ 0:9:57.356479854.
DEBUG (0): Timer A is good @ 0:9:57.837925167.
DEBUG (0): Timer A is good @ 0:9:58.837925167.
DEBUG (0): Timer B is good @ 0:9:59.648472042.
DEBUG (0): Timer A is good @ 0:9:59.837925167.
DEBUG (0): Timer A is good @ 0:10:0.837925167.
DEBUG (0): Timer A is good @ 0:10:1.837925167.
DEBUG (0): Timer A is good @ 0:10:2.837925167.
DEBUG (0): Timer A is good @ 0:10:3.837925167.

If there is a timer bug, then the output will read

DEBUG (0): Timer A is off. Should have fired in X, fired in Y @ Z.
