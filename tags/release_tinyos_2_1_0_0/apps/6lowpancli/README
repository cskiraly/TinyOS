6lowpan cli is a sample application using the 6lowpan stack. It
implements a cli listening on UDP port 1234 for commands and replying
with answers.

Besides that, the mote answers to pings.

The IPv6 addresses
 * a global address with prefix 2001:0638:0709:1234::/64
 * a link-local address
are assigned using an interface identifier computed from the Active
Message address of the mote. This is almost like the stateless
autoconfiguration, but Duplicate Address Detection or Router
Solicitations are not implemented.


Note that you also need a BaseStation application and the serial_tun
daemon running. See tos/lib/net/6lowpan/REAME for more details.

			       BUILDING
Debugging output with printf over USB can be enabled with
	CFLAGS="-D'ENABLE_PRINTF_DEBUG=1'

To minimize memory usage, i.e. disable everything (at the moment only
the UDP cli) to determine minimum RAM/ROM requirements, use
	CFLAGS="-D'MINIMIZE_MEMORY=1'


			       TESTING
Assuming active message address (mote id) 20 (0x14):

Small unfragmented ping
	sudo ping6 -s 50 2001:638:709:1234::fffe:14

Large fragmented ping
	sudo ping6 -s 1230 -i 3 2001:638:709:1234::fffe:14

Link-local all-nodes ping
	sudo ping6 -s 20 ff02::01

UDP cli
	nc6 -u  2001:638:709:1234::fffe:14 1234
