This is a simple configuration and test driver to test tree building and link
estimation. Currently to be used in simulation, because it does not have any
debugging or state output to the radio.

The nesc files just wire and start the tree building, with no data traffic.
Nodes 0 and 173, when started, are set as roots.

The python script starts node 173 later, so in the first phase there should be
one tree and when the node boots, there should be two trees, one rooted at
0, the other at 173.
