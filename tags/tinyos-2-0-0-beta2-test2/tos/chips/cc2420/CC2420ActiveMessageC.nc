 * The Active Message layer for the CC2420 radio. This configuration
 * just layers the AM dispatch (CC2420ActiveMessageM) on top of the
 * underlying CC2420 radio packet (CC2420CsmaRadioC), which is
 * inherently an AM packet (acknowledgements based on AM destination
 * addr and group). Note that snooping may not work, due to CC2420
 * early packet rejection if acknowledgements are enabled.
