Welcome to TinyOS 2.0

TinyOS 2.0 has been designed by a working group comprised of companies
and institutions hailing from three continents
(http://www.tinyos.net/scoop/special/working_group_tinyos_2-0).  A
primary 2.0 design goal was to maximize TinyOS' platform portability,
a goal that led to the adaption of the 2.0 Hardware Abstraction
Architecture (HAA). All of the TinyOS 2.0 design is described in the
TinyOS Extension Protocol (TEP) documents linked from the 
TinyOS Working Group page (see link above).

TEP   2: Hardware Abstraction Architecture
TEP 101: ADC
TEP 102: Timers
TEP 103: Permanent Data 
TEP 104: Radio Physical Layer
TEP 105: Radio Link Layer
TEP 106: Schedulers and Tasks 
TEP 107: Boot Sequence
TEP 108: Resource Arbitration
TEP 109: Sensorboards

In addition to the design changes described in the above TEPs, 2.0 also
includes infrastructure changes. The directory structure has been modified
to enhance platform portability and ease of use, and TinyOS 2.0 
requires Tinyos-Tools 1.2 as well as NesC 1.2. 

PreRelease1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PreRelease1 is a subset of what will become the full 2.0 release. PreRelease1
includes platform support for mica2 and sample applications built using
a new TinyOS component architecture (OSKI). 

Installation:
Please see doc/html/upgrade-tools.html for how to upgrade from a 1.x 
environment to a 2.x environment. upgrade-tools.html also explains how
to maintain  1.x and  2.x trees simultaneously.

Known problems:
You might need to use the '--noscripts' option to uninstall 
tinyos-tools. We have seen at least one case of the tinyos-tools 
rpm hanging on uninstall. If rpm hangs after installing tinyos-tools, 
you can kill it with the task manager. 

The CC1000 radio stack currently has some reliability problems; we
expect to address these in an upcoming 2.0 prerelease.
