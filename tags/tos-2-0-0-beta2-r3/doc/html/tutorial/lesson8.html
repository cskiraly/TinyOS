<p>Commands and events that are executed as part
of a hardware event handler must be declared with the <b>async</b>
keyword (more about the async keyword in Lesson 8). </p>

<p>Because tasks and hardware event handlers may be preempted by other
asynchronous code, nesC programs are susceptible to certain race
conditions. Races are avoided either by accessing shared data
exclusively  within tasks, or by having all accesses within <b>atomic</b>
statements. The nesC compiler reports potential <b>data races</b> to the
programmer at compile-time. It is possible the compiler may report a
false positive. In this case a variable can be declared with the <b>norace</b>
keyword. The norace keyword should be used with extreme caution. </p>

Reference Manual</a> for more information on programming in nesC. <br>
