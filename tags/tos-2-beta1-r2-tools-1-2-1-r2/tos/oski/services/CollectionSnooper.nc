/**
 * The OSKI presentation of overhearing a collection routing packet
 * that is sent to another node. The Intercept.intercepted() event is
 * only signaled when a node receives a routing packet whose next hop
 * is another node. The return value of the event is ignored.  If the
 * packet's next hop is the node, then either the
 * CollectionInterceptor (if it is a next hop) or CollectionReceiver
 * (if it is a tree root) will instead be used. CollectionSnooper is a
 * way for a component to overhear routed messages from other nodes if
 * it is a leaf in the network.
