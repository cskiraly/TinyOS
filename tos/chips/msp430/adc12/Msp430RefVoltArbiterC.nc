/** 
 * This component is meant to intercept requests to the <code>Resource</code>
 * interface on their way to the arbiter. It checks whether the client requires
 * the internal reference voltage generator of the MSP430 to be switched on by
 * pulling its configuration data via <code>Msp430Adc12Config</code>. If (and
 * only if) this is the case it enables the generator and forwards the
 * <code>Resource.granted()</code> event from the arbiter when the reference
 * voltage is stable.  Clients SHOULD NOT wire to
 * <code>Msp430RefVoltArbiterC</code> but wire to
 * <code>Msp430Adc12RefVoltAutoClientC</code>.
