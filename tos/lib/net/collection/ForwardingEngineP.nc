/**
 *  The ForwardingEngine is responsible for queueing and scheduling outgoing
 *  packets in a collection protocol. It maintains a pool of forwarding messages 
 *  and a packet send 
 *  queue. A ForwardingEngine with a forwarding message pool of size <i>F</i> 
 *  and <i>C</i> CollectionSenderC clients has a send queue of size
 *  <i>F + C</i>. This implementation has a large number of configuration
 *  constants, which can be found in <code>ForwardingEngine.h</code>.
 *
 *  <p>Packets in the send queue are sent in FIFO order, with head-of-line
 *  blocking. Because this is a tree collection protocol, all packets are going
 *  to the same destination, and so the ForwardingEngine does not distinguish
 *  packets from one another: packets from CollectionSenderC clients are
 *  treated identically to forwarded packets.</p>
 *
 *  <p>If ForwardingEngine is on top of a link layer that supports
 *  synchronous acknowledgments, it enables them and retransmits packets
 *  when they are not acked. It transmits a packet up to MAX_RETRIES times
 *  before giving up and dropping the packet.</p> 
 *
 *  <p>The ForwardingEngine detects routing loops and tries to correct
 *  them. It assumes that the collection tree is based on a gradient,
 *  such as hop count or estimated transmissions. When the ForwardingEngine
 *  sends a packet to the next hop, it puts the local gradient value in
 *  the packet header. If a node receives a packet to forward whose
 *  gradient value is less than its own, then the gradient is not monotonically
 *  decreasing and there may be a routing loop. When the ForwardingEngine
 *  receives such a packet, it tells the RoutingEngine to advertise its
 *  gradient value soon, with the hope that the advertisement will update
 *  the node who just sent a packet and break the loop.
 *  
 *  <p>ForwardingEngine times its packet transmissions. It differentiates
 *  between four transmission cases: forwarding, success, ack failure, 
 *  and loop detection. In each case, the
 *  ForwardingEngine waits a randomized period of time before sending the next
 *  packet. This approach assumes that the network is operating at low
 *  utilization; its goal is to prevent correlated traffic -- such as 
 *  nodes along a route forwarding packets -- from interfering with itself.
