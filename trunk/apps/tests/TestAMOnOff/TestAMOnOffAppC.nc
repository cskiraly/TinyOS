/**
 *  This OSKI test application tests whether OSKI can turn the active
 *  message service on and off. It has two versions: slave and master,
 *  which are set by a command line -D: SERVICE_SLAVE or
 *  SERVICE_MASTER. A master is always on, and transmits data packets
 *  at 1Hz. Every 5s, it transmits a power message. When a slave hears
 *  a data message, it toggles its red led; when it hears a power
 *  message, it turns off its radio, which it turns back on in a few
 *  seconds. This essentially tests whether ActiveMessageC is turning
 *  the radio off appropriately. It uses AM types 240 (power messages)
 *  and 241 (data messages).
