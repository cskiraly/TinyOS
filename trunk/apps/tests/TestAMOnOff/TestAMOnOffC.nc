/**
 *  Implementation of the OSKI TestAMOnOff application. This
 *  application has two versions: slave and master. A master is always
 *  on, and transmits data packets at 1Hz. Every 5s, it transmits a
 *  power message. When a slave hears a data message, it toggles its
 *  red led; when it hears a power message, it turns off its radio,
 *  which it turns back on in a few seconds. This essentially tests
 *  whether ActiveMessageC is turning the radio off appropriately.
