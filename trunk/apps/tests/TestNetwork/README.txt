Description:

TestNetworkC exercises the basic networking layers, collection and
dissemination. The application samples DemoSensorC at a basic rate
and sends packets up a collection tree. The rate is configurable
through dissemination.

See TEP118: Dissemination, TEP 119: Collection, and TEP 123: The
Collection Tree Protocol for details.

There are scripts on net2 website to parse the debug messages sent by
the nodes.
