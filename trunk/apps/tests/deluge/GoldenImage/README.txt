Description:

This is a sample application for Deluge T2. The application is similar 
to Null, but it includes Deluge T2.

To program a basestation (a mote which can accept images over the
serial port) you have to add CFLAGS=-DDELUGE_BASESTATION to the make
command. For telosb this might look like this:
	 CFLAGS=-DDELUGE_BASESTATION make telosb install bsl,/dev/ttyUSB0

Prerequisites:

Python 2.4 with pySerial
