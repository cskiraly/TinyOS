TestTransmit:

This application sends a very short message (2 bytes) every 2000 ticks
without checking for other traffic. We want to test if the radio driver
locks up because we want to transmit while receiving another message.

It blinks the 0th LED (red) when 256 times RadioSend.send() returns with
an error. It blinks the 1st LED (green) when 256 times the RadioSend.send()
returns with success. It blinks the 2nd LED (yellow) when 256 times the
RadioAlarm fires. 

Program two or more motes with this application, then start them. You 
should see the 2nd LED (yellow) blink continuously, and the 1st and 0th
LED (green and red) blink too. If both the 0th and 1st LED stops blinking
the the radio driver locked up.

You can also connect one of your motes to your PC and run there the
java.net.tinyos.util.DiagMsg application. This should print out ASSERTS
of the radio driver.
