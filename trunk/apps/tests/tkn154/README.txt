Description:

This folder contains test applications for "TKN15.4", a platform-independent
IEEE 802.15.4-2006 MAC implementation. Every test application resides in a
separate subdirectory which includes a README.txt describing what it does and
how it can be installed, respectively.

The TKN15.4 implementation can be found in tinyos-2.x/tos/lib/mac/tkn154.
