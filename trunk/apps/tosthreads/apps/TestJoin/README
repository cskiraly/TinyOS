Description:

TestJoin is a simple application used to test the basic functionality of
the join() system call for waiting on a set of threads in a TOSThreads 
based application.

You can install TestJoin on a mote via the following command:
  make <platform> threads install
  
Valid platforms are currently: tmote, telosb, iris, mica2, micaz, and epic

Upon a successful burn, you should see LED2 toggles at the end of each time
period. In addition, during each time period, LED0 should toggle twice, and LED1
toggles four times (with an interval of 1 sec). This LED behavior repeats in the
next time period.

Tools:
  None.

Known bugs/limitations:
  None.
