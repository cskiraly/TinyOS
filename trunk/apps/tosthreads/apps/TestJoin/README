Description:

TestJoin is a simple application used to test the basic functionality of
the join() system call for waiting on a set of threads in a TOSThreads 
based application.

You can install TestJoin on a mote via the following command:
  make <platform> threads install
  
Valid platforms are currently: tmote, telosb, iris, mica2, and micaz 

Upon a successful burn, you should first see LED0 flash twice with a period of
1s and LED1 flash 4 times with a period of 1s. After these are done,
LED2 should come on and stay on.

Tools:
  None.

Known bugs/limitations:
  None.
