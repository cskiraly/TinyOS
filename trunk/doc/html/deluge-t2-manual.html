<h1>1&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</h1>
<p></p>
<p>
Deluge is a reliable data dissemination protocol for large objects, such 
as program binaries. Together with a bootloader, Deluge provides a way 
to reprogram sensor motes in a network. Deluge is maintained by Jonathan 
Hui, and Deluge 2.0 is the most recent version. Documentations on Deluge 
2.0 are available at 
<a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jwhui/research/deluge/">http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jwhui/research/deluge/</a>.</p>
<p>
Deluge T2 is an effort to port Deluge 2.0 from TinyOS 1 to TinyOS 2. 
Although the code from Deluge 2.0 is reused as much as possible, the 
behavior and the usage of Deluge T2 are not entirely identical to Deluge 
2.0. Having said that, it would still be helpful to read the Deluge 2.0 
manual and related documentations.</p>
<p>
Deluge T2 is still in experimental phase. One current limitation is 
platform support. Deluge T2 has been developed on Tmote Sky (<i>telosb</i>) 
and MicaZ only. In addition, Deluge T2 comes with 2 flash volumes by 
default. However, more volumes can be added, if necessary. There are 
also some minor details that will be improved in future releases.</p>
<p>

<h1>2&nbsp;&nbsp;Tools Installation</h1>
<p>Deluge T2 requires a few Python scripts that not yet included in the
official <code class=verbatim>tinyos-tools</code> RPM package. On the CVS, the scripts are
located in <code class=verbatim>tinyos-2.x/tools/tinyos/misc</code>. The steps to install
them are the following:</p>
<p>
</p>
<pre class=verbatim>  % cd $TOSROOT/tools
  % ./Bootstrap
      ...
  % ./configure
      ...
  % cd tinyos/misc
  % make ; make install
      ...
</pre><p></p>
<p>
By default, the files will be installed in <code class=verbatim>/usr/local/bin</code>. If
desired, the <code class=verbatim>--prefix</code> parameter from <code class=verbatim>configure</code> can be
used to indicate a different path. </p>
<p>
</p>

<h1>3&nbsp;&nbsp;Quick Start</h1>
<p></p>
<p>
This section introduces the basics of reprogramming with an example. In 
addition, it provides a quick test for software prerequisite. The latest 
TinyOS 2 CVS tree and Python 2.4 with pySerial support are recommended 
for running Deluge T2.</p>
<p>
To start the example, we first compile tosboot provided in <code class=verbatim>tinyos-2.x/tos/lib/tosboot</code>.
For example,
</p>
<pre class=verbatim>   % make telosb
</pre><p>
Then, we run the <code class=verbatim>burn</code> script provided in <code class=verbatim>tinyos-2.x/apps/tests/deluge/Blink</code>.
For example,
</p>
<pre class=verbatim>   % ./burn /dev/ttyUSB0 telosb
</pre><p>
This <code class=verbatim>burn</code> script programs the directly-connected mote with one 
version of Blink. Then, it injects and reprograms the mote with another 
version of Blink. At this point, you can try to retrieve program image 
versioning information. The script to interface with the mote is 
provided in <code class=verbatim>tinyos-2.x/tools/tinyos/misc</code>. For example,
</p>
<pre class=verbatim>   % tos-deluge /dev/ttyUSB0 telosb -p 0
</pre><p>
You should see something similar to the output below.

any arguments, and it will be discussed in section <a href="#node_sec_5">5</a>.</p>

<h1>4&nbsp;&nbsp;Reprogramming a Network</h1>
<p></p>
<p>
This section illustrates the procedure to reprogram a network. 
Specifically, we will see how program images are injected and how 
versioning information is retrieved.</p>
<p>
</p>
<a name="node_sec_4.1"></a>
<h2>4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting Up the Motes</h2>
<p>We first install both tosboot and a program that runs Deluge T2. For 
simplicity, we use the golden image as the program. The golden image is 
provided in <code class=verbatim>tinyos-2.x/apps/tests/deluge/GoldenImage</code>, and it does 
nothing except initializing Deluge T2. This step can be done by 
compiling and programming the mote normally. For example,
</p>
<pre class=verbatim>   % CFLAGS=-DDELUGE_BASESTATION make telosb install,0 bsl,/dev/ttyUSB0
</pre><p>
<code class=verbatim>CFLAGS=-DDELUGE_BASESTATION</code> indicates that the current mote will 
act as a base station, which requires an additional component to accept 
user commands from the serial port. Normally, only one mote in the 
network needs to be the base station, and other motes are reprogrammed 
over-the-air. If error occurs when running the command above, you might 
need to compile tosboot as shown in section <a href="#node_sec_3">3</a>. 
Deluge T2 makes sure the mote ID remain persistent over image 
reprogramming. You can test the installation by interacting with the 
mote through <code class=verbatim>tos-deluge</code>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<a name="node_sec_4.2"></a>
<h2>4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparing Your Application</h2>
<p>In most cases, the only two files you need to modify are the top-level
wiring file and the Makefile. You need to make sure <code class=verbatim>DelugeC</code>
component is included. In addition, the Makefile should have the
following line:
</p>
<pre class=verbatim>   TINYOS_NP=BNP
</pre><p>
Finally, compile your application without installing it on the mote. For 
example,
</p>
<pre class=verbatim>   % make telosb
</pre><p></p>
<p>
</p>
<a name="node_sec_4.3"></a>
<h2>4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Injecting Your Application</h2>
<p>Before a program image is disseminated in the network, we need to first 
inject it to the base station. For example,
</p>
<pre class=verbatim>   % tos-deluge /dev/ttyUSB0 telosb -i 1 apps/Blink/build/telosb/tos_image.xml
</pre><p>
You should see something similar to the output below.</p>
<p>
</p>
<pre class=verbatim>   Pinging node ...

<h2>4.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Reprogramming with New Image</h2>
<p>After you decide which program image you want to reprogram, you can 
first test on the base station by issuing the reboot command. For 
example,
</p>
<pre class=verbatim>   % tos-deluge /dev/ttyUSB0 telosb -b 1
</pre><p>
After a few moments, the mote will begin quickly flashing the LEDs to 
signify the reprogramming process.</p>
<p>
Now, you can have the base station disseminate a program image to the rest of 
the network. For example,
</p>
<pre class=verbatim>   % tos-deluge /dev/ttyUSB0 telosb -d 1
</pre><p>
This command instructs the base station to notify the whole network of 
the availability of a new program image. This notification is currently 
done via TinyOS dissemination service, and it triggers all motes in the 
network to get the new program image. After all motes receive the image 
over-the-air, you can instruct the base station to disseminate the 
command to reprogram in the network. For example,
</p>
<pre class=verbatim>   % tos-deluge /dev/ttyUSB0 telosb -r 1
</pre><p></p>

<h1>5&nbsp;&nbsp;Deluge T2 Python Toolchain</h1>
<p></p>
<p>
Different from Deluge 2.0, Deluge T2 toolchain is written in Python. 
However, as demonstrated in the previous section, the usage is similar.</p>
<p>
</p>
<a name="node_sec_5.1"></a>
<h2>5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;-p -ping</h2>
<p>This command is useful for checking the status of program images on a 
mote. It provides information such as program name, compile time, size 
of the image, and so on.</p>
<p>
</p>
<a name="node_sec_5.2"></a>
<h2>5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;-i -inject</h2>
<p>This command creates a program image from the supplied 
<code class=verbatim>tos_image.xml</code> file, and it injects the image into specified 
volume on the mote. All versioning information is kept on the mote, so 
no state is stored on the PC.</p>
<p>
</p>
<a name="node_sec_5.3"></a>
<h2>5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;-b -reprogram_bs</h2>
<p>This command sets up the mote to reprogram itself after reboot, and then 
it reboots the mote. This command is applicable only to the base station 
mote.</p>
<p>
</p>
<a name="node_sec_5.4"></a>
<h2>5.4&nbsp;&nbsp;-d -dissemination</h2>
<p>This command instructs the base station mote to disseminate an image to 
the network. This image is specified by the volume ID.</p>
<p>
</p>
<a name="node_sec_5.5"></a>
<h2>5.5&nbsp;&nbsp;-r -reprogram</h2>
<p>This command instructs the base station mote to disseminate the 
command to reprogram in the network. This command does not reprogram the 
base station mote. The image is specified by the volume ID.</p>
<p>
</p>
<a name="node_sec_5.6"></a>
<h2>5.6&nbsp;&nbsp;-e -erase</h2>
<p>This command erases a flash volume on the base station mote.</p>
<p>
</p>
<a name="node_sec_5.7"></a>
<h2>5.7&nbsp;&nbsp;-s -reset</h2>
<p>This command resets versioning information of a specific image on the 
base station mote.</p>
<p>
