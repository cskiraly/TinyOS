<div class="title">Lesson 5: Sensing</div>
<div class="subtitle">Last Modified: 16 June 2006</div>

<p> This lesson introduces sensor data acquisition in TinyOS. It demonstrates
two sensor applications: a simple application called <a href="#sense">Sense</a>
that periodically takes sensor readings and displays the values on the LEDs.
And a more sophisticated application called <a
href="#oscilloscope">Oscilloscope</a> where nodes periodically broadcast their
sensor readings to a basestation node. Using the Mote-PC serial communication
described in the <a href="lesson4.html">previous lesson</a> the basestation
forwards the sensor readings to the PC, where they are visualized with a
dedicated graphical user interface.  

<a name="introduction"><h1>Introduction</h1></a>

<p> Sensing is an integral part of sensor network applications. In TinyOS 1.x
sensing was syntactically connected with analog-to-digital converters (ADCs):
TinyOS 1.x applications such as <code>Oscilloscope</code> or <code>Sense</code>
used the <code>ADC</code> and <code>ADCControl</code> interfaces to collect
sensor data. When new platforms appeared with sensors that were read out via
the serial interface, not only did additional interfaces like
<code>ADCError</code> have to be introduced, but it became clear that equating
a sensor with an ADC was not always the appropriate thing to do.

<p> Usually sensing involves two tasks: configuring a sensor (and/or the
hardware module it is attached to, for example the ADC or SPI bus) and reading
the sensor data.  The first task is tricky, because a sensing application like,
for example, <code>Sense</code> is meant to run on any TinyOS platform. How can
<code>Sense</code> know the configuration details (like ADC input channel, the
required reference voltage, etc.) of an attached sensor? It can't, because the
configuration details of sensors will be different from platform to platform.
Unless <code>Sense</code> knows about all sensors on all platforms it will be
unable to perform the configuration task.  However, the second task - reading
the sensor data - can be solved so that the <code>Sense</code> application can
collect sensor data even though it is agnostic to the platform it is running
on. 

<p> In TinyOS 2.0 <i>platform independent</i> sensing applications such as
<code>Oscilloscope</code>, <code>Sense</code> or <code>RadioSenseToLeds</code>
do not use configuration interfaces like <code>ADCControl</code> anymore;
instead they use the standard data acquisition interfaces
<code>Read</code>, <code>ReadStream</code> or <code>ReadNow</code> for
collecting sensor data. All configuration details are hidden from the
application and this is why you can compile <code>Sense</code> and display
sensor data on the <i>telosb</i> or the <i>micaz</i> platform, even though the
actual sensors and their connection to the rest of the system may be completely
different.

<p> This raises questions like the following:

<ul>

<li> Since the <code>Sense</code> application component only uses standard
data acquisition interfaces who is in charge of defining which sensor it samples?

<li> If the <code>Sense</code> application component is not configuring the
sensor, then who is responsible for that?

<li> How can an applications like <code>Sense</code> display sensor data when they
do not know the details about sensor configuration? This includes questions
like "what is the value range of the sensor data" or "is a temperature reading
to be interpreted in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit"?

<li> Let's assume there are several sensors on a platform: what steps have to
be taken to let the <code>Sense</code> or <code>Oscilloscope</code> application
display data from a different sensor?

</ul> 

<p> After reading this tutorial you should be able to answer these questions.
Using the <code>Sense</code> and <code>Oscilloscope</code> application as an
example, the following sections explain how the data acquisition interfaces are
used, how the configuration procedure works and, as an example, how
<code>Sense</code> can be hooked up to sensors other than the default one on
the <i>telosb</i> platform.

<a name="sense"><h1>The Sense application</h1></a>

<code>Sense</code> is a simple sensing demo application. It periodically
samples the default sensor and displays the bottom bits of the readings on the
LEDs. The <code>Sense</code> application can be found in
<code>tinyos-2.x/apps/Sense</code>.  Let's first look at the <code><a
href="../../../apps/Sense/SenseAppC.nc">SenseAppC.nc</a></code> configuration:

<pre>
configuration SenseAppC 
{ 
} 
implementation { 
  components SenseC, MainC, LedsC, new TimerMilliC();
  components new DemoSensorC() as Sensor;

  SenseC.Boot -> MainC;
  SenseC.Leds -> LedsC;
  SenseC.Timer -> TimerMilliC;
  SenseC.Read -> Sensor;
}
</pre>

The <code>SenseAppC</code> configuration looks similar to the
<code>BlinkAppC</code> configuration described in <a href="lesson1.html">lesson
1</a> (if you have not done so, read the sections on the Blink application in
lesson 1). To understand the wiring let's look at the signature of the <code><a
href="../../../apps/Sense/SenseC.nc">SenseC.nc</a></code> module:

<pre>
module SenseC
{
  uses {
    interface Boot;
    interface Leds;
    interface Timer&lt;TMilli&gt;;
    interface Read&lt;uint16_t&gt;;
  }
} 
</pre>

Like the <code>BlinkC.nc</code> module the <code>SenseC.nc</code> module uses
the interfaces <code>Boot</code>, <code>Leds</code> and
<code>Timer&lt;TMilli&gt;</code>. Additionally, it uses the
<code>Read&lt;uint16_t&gt;</code> interface. The 	sequence of actions in the
<code>SenseC.nc</code> implementation is as follows: <code>SenseC.nc</code>
uses the <code>Boot</code> interface to start a periodic timer after the system
has been initialized. Every time the timer expires <code>SenseC.nc</code> is
signalled a timer event and reads data via the
<code>Read&lt;uint16_t&gt;</code> interface. Reading data is a split-phase
operation, it is divided in a command <code>Read.read()</code> and an event
<code>Read.readDone()</code>. Thus every time the timer expires
<code>SenseC.nc</code> calls <code>Read.read()</code> and waits for the
<code>Read.readDone()</code> event. When data is signalled in the
<code>Read.readDone()</code> event <code>SenseC.nc</code> displays it on the
leds: the least significant bit is displayed on LED 0 (0 = off, 1 = on), the
second least significant bit is displayed on LED 1 and so on. <p> The <code><a
href="../../../tos/interfaces/Read.nc">Read</a></code> interface (in
<code>tinyos-2.x/tos/interfaces</code>) can be used to read a single piece of
sensor data, let's look at it in detail:

<pre>
interface Read&lt;val_t&gt; {
  /**
   * Initiates a read of the value.
   *
   * @return SUCCESS if a readDone() event will eventually come back.
   */
  command error_t read();

  /**
   * Signals the completion of the read().
   *
   * @param result SUCCESS if the read() was successful
   * @param val the value that has been read
   */
  event void readDone( error_t result, val_t val );
}
</pre>

If you are not familiar with generic interfaces you will wonder what the
meaning of <code>&lt;val_t&gt;</code> (in the first line) is and why the
signature of <code>SenseC.nc</code> is using <code>Read&lt;uint16_t&gt;</code>.
What you see above is a <i>generic interface definition</i>, because the
<code>Read</code> interface takes a type parameter. Generic interfaces are
explained in the nesC Language Reference Manual (version 1.2 and above).
For now it is enough to know that generic interfaces have at least one type
parameter and two components can be wired together only if they provide/use the
interface with the same types (note that the <code>readDone</code> event passes
a parameter of the <code>&lt;val_t&gt;</code> parameter, which is a placeholder
for the actual data type). This means that since <code>SenseC.nc</code> is
using the <code>uint16_t</code> variant of the <code>Read</code> interface, it
can only be wired to a component that provides the
<code>Read&lt;uint16_t&gt;</code> interface and thus <code>SenseC.nc</code>
expects to read 16 bit unsigned integer sensor data.  If you tried to wire
<code>SenseC.nc</code> to a component that provides, for example, a
<code>Read&lt;uint8_t&gt;</code> interface you would get an error from the
nesC compiler. 

<p>Recall that the wiring is defined in the <code>SenseAppC.nc</code>
configuration. Let's again take a look at which component <code>SenseC.nc</code>
is wired to using the <code>Read&lt;uint16_t&gt;</code> interface in the
<code>SenseAppC</code> configuration. The interesting lines are

<pre>
  components new DemoSensorC() as Sensor;
</pre>
and
<pre>
  SenseC.Read -> Sensor;
</pre>

This means that the <i>generic</i> <code>DemoSensorC</code> component provides
the <code>Read&lt;uint16_t&gt;</code> interface to <code>SenseC.nc</code>

<p> It is important to understand that the <code>SenseC.nc</code> module has no
way of telling which sensor it is connected to; in fact it cannot even tell
whether it is getting data from a sensor at all, because it can be wired to any
component that provides a <code>Read&lt;uint16_t&gt;</code> interface. On a
platform without any built-in sensors (like <i>micaz</i>) and no attached
sensorboard the <code>DemoSensorC</code> component could simply return constant
values. The last sentence hints that the <code>DemoSensorC</code> component is
different for every platform: therefore you will not find
<code>DemoSensorC.nc</code> in the TinyOS libraries. Instead, a different
<code>DemoSensorC.nc</code> has to be written for every platform, i.e. the
<code>DemoSensorC.nc</code> implementation for telosb will be different than
the <code>DemoSensorC.nc</code> implementation for micaz.  This is the
answer to the first question asked in the <a
href="#introduction">introduction</a> section: the <i>platform dependent</i>
<code>DemoSensorC</code> component defines which sensor the <code>Sense</code>
or <code>Oscilloscope</code> application is sampling and every platform that
wants to run sensing applications such as <code>Oscilloscope</code>,
<code>Sense</code> or <code>RadioSenseToLeds</code> has to provide its own
version of <code>DemoSensorC</code>. Additionally, sensor boards may come
with their own version of <code>DemoSensorC</code> (e.g., the 
<code>basicsb</code> sensorboard for the mica-family of motes define 
<code>DemoSensorC.nc</code> to be that board's light sensor).

<a name="demosensorc"><h2>The DemoSensorC component</h2></a>

<p> Let's take a closer look at the <code>DemoSensorC</code> component. Every
<code>DemoSensorC</code> component has the following signature:

<pre>
generic configuration DemoSensorC()
{
  provides interface Read&lt;uint16_t&gt;;
}
</pre>

In its implementation section, however, <code>DemoSensorC</code> may differ
from platform to platform. For example, on the <i>telosb</i> platform
<code>DemoSensorC</code> instantiates a component called <code>VoltageC</code>,
which reads data from the MCU-internal voltage sensor. Because the <i>micaz</i>
doesn't have any built-in sensors its <code>DemoSensorC</code> uses system
library component like <code>ConstantSensorC</code> or
<code>SineSensorC</code>, which return "fake" sensor data. Thus
<code>DemoSensorC</code> is a means of indirecting sensor data acquisition from
a platform-specific sensor component (like <code>VoltageC</code>) to
platform-independent applications like <code>Sense</code> or
<code>Oscilloscope</code>. Usually the configuration of a sensor is done in the
component that <code>DemoSensorC</code> instantiates.

<p> How can <code>Sense</code> be changed to sample a sensor other than the platform's
default sensor? Usually this requires changing only a single line of code in
<code>DemoSensorC</code>; for example, if you wanted to replace the
<code>VoltageC</code> component on <i>telosb</i> by the constant sensor
component <code>ConstantSensorC</code> you could change the follwoing line in
<code>DemoSensorC</code> from:

<pre>
components new VoltageC() as DemoSensor;
</pre>
to something like
<pre>
components new ConstantSensorC(uint16_t, 0xbeef) as DemoSensor;
</pre>

What sensors are available depends on the platform. Sensor components are
usually located in the respective platform subdirectory
(<code>tinyos-2.x/tos/platforms</code>), in the respective sensorboard
subdirectory (<code>tinyos-2.x/tos/sensorboards</code>) or, in case of
microprocessor-internal sensors, in the respective chips subdirectory
(<code>tinyos-2.x/tos/chips</code>). <code>ConstantSensorC</code> and
<code>SineSensorC</code> can be found in <code>tinyos-2.x/tos/system</code>.


<h2>Running the Sense application</h2>

To compile the <code>Sense</code> application, go to the
<code>apps/Sense</code> directory and depending on which hardware you have,
type something similar to <code>make telosb install</code>.  If you get errors such as 
the following,

<pre>
SenseAppC.nc:50: component DemoSensorC not found
SenseAppC.nc:50: component `DemoSensorC' is not generic
SenseAppC.nc:55: no match
</pre>

your platform has not yet implemented the <code>DemoSensorC</code> component.
For a quick solution you can copy <code>DemoSensorC.nc</code> from
<code>tinyos-2.x/tos/platforms/micaz</code> to your platform directory (a good
starting point on how to create sensor components is probably <a
  href="../tep101.html">TEP 101</a> and <a href="../tep114.html">TEP 114</a>). 

<p>If you have a mica-family mote and a "basic" (mda100) sensor board, you
can get a more interesting test by compiling with
<pre>
SENSORBOARD=basicsb make <i>platform</i> install
</pre>
to run <code>Sense</code> using the mda100's light sensor.

<p> Once you have installed the application the three least significant bits of
the sensor readings are displayed on the node's LEDs (0 = off, 1 = on). It is
the least significant bits, because <code>Sense</code> cannot know the
precision (value range) of the returned sensor readings and, for example, the
three most significant bits in a <code>uint16_t</code> sensor reading sampled
through a 12-bit ADC would be meaningless (unless the value was left-shifted).
If your <code>DemoSensorC</code> represents a sensor whose readings are
fluctuating you may see the LEDs toggle, otherwise <code>Sense</code> is not
very impressive.  Let's take a look at a more interesting application:
<code>Oscilloscope</code>.

<a name="oscilloscope"><h1>The Oscilloscope application</h1></a>

<code>Oscilloscope</code> is an application that let's you visualize sensor
readings on the PC. Every node that has <code>Oscilloscope</code> installed
periodically samples the default sensor (<a href="#demosensorc">via
<code>DemoSensorC</code></a>) and broadcasts a message with 10 accumulated
readings over the radio. A node running the <code>BaseStation</code>
application will forward these messages to the PC using the serial
communication. To run <code>Oscilloscope</code> you therefore need at least two
nodes: one node attached to your PC running the <code>BaseStation</code>
application (<code>BaseStation</code> can be found at
<code>tinyos-2.x/apps/BaseStation</code> and was introduced in the <a
href="lesson4.html">previous lesson</a>) and one or more nodes running the
<code>Oscilloscope</code> application. 

<p> Let's take a look at the <code><a
href="../../../apps/Oscilloscope/OscilloscopeAppC.nc">OscilloscopeAppC.nc</a></code>
configuration:

<pre>
configuration OscilloscopeAppC 
{ 
}
implementation
{
  components OscilloscopeC, MainC, ActiveMessageC, LedsC,
    new TimerMilliC(), new DemoSensorC() as Sensor,
    new AMSenderC(AM_OSCILLOSCOPE), new AMReceiverC(AM_OSCILLOSCOPE);

  OscilloscopeC.Boot -> MainC;
  OscilloscopeC.RadioControl -> ActiveMessageC;
  OscilloscopeC.AMSend -> AMSenderC;
  OscilloscopeC.Receive -> AMReceiverC;
  OscilloscopeC.Timer -> TimerMilliC;
  OscilloscopeC.Read -> Sensor;
  OscilloscopeC.Leds -> LedsC;
}
</pre>

The actual implementation of the application is in <code><a
href="../../../apps/Oscilloscope/OscilloscopeC.nc">OscilloscopeC.nc</a></code>.
This is the signature of <code>OscilloscopeC.nc</code>:

<pre>
module OscilloscopeC
{
  uses {
    interface Boot;
    interface SplitControl as RadioControl;
    interface AMSend;
    interface Receive;
    interface Timer<TMilli>;
    interface Read<uint16_t>;
    interface Leds;
  }
}
</pre>

<code>Oscilloscope</code> is a combination of different building blocks
introduced in previous parts of the tutorial. Like <a
  href="#sense"><code>Sense</code></a>,  <code>Oscilloscope</code> uses
<code>DemoSensorC</code> and a timer to periodically sample the default sensor
of a platform. When it has gathered 10 sensor readings
<code>OscilloscopeC</code> puts them into a message and broadcasts that message
via the <code>AMSend</code> interface.  <code>OscilloscopeC</code> uses the
<code>Receive</code> interface for synchronization purposes (see below) and the
<code>SplitControl</code> interface, to switch the radio on. If you want to
know more about mote-mote radio communication read <a
  href="lesson3.html">lesson 3</a>.

<h2>Running the Oscilloscope application</h2>

To install the <code>Oscilloscope</code> application go to
<code>tinyos-2.x/apps/Oscilloscope</code> and depending on which hardware you
have, type something similar to <code>make telosb install,1</code>. Note the "<code>,1</code>"
after the <code>install</code> option, which assigns ID 1 to the node.
Assigning IDs to nodes is helpful to differentiate them later on in the GUI, so
make sure you assign different IDs to all nodes on which
<code>Oscilloscope</code> is installed (e.g. install <code>Oscilloscope</code>
on a second node with <code>make telosb install,2</code> and so on). A node
running <code>Oscilloscope</code> will toggle its second LED for every message
it has sent and it will toggle its third LED when it has received an
<code>Oscilloscope</code> message from another node: incoming messages are used
for sequence number synchronization to let nodes catch up when they are
switched on later than the others; they are also used for changing the sample
rate that defines how often sensor values are read. In case of a problem with
the radio connection the first LED will toggle. 

<p> Install <code>BaseStation</code> on another node and connect it to your PC.
As usual, on the <code>BaseStation</code> node you should see the second LED
toggle for every message bridged from radio to serial.


<h2>Running the Java GUI</h2>

To visualize the sensor readings on your PC first go to
<code>tinyos-2.x/apps/Oscilloscope/java</code> and type <code>make</code>. This
creates/compiles the necessary message classes and the
<code>Oscilloscope</code> Java GUI. Now start a SerialForwarder and make sure
it connects to the node on which you have installed the
<code>BaseStation</code> application (how this is done is explained in the <a
  href="lesson4.html">previous lesson</a>). In case you have problems with the
Java compilation or the serial connection work through the <a
  href="lesson4.html">previous lesson</a>. 

<p>Once you have a SerialForwarder running you can start the GUI by typing
<code>./run</code> (in <code>tinyos-2.x/apps/Oscilloscope/java</code>). You
should see a window similar to the one below:

<p>
<CENTER>
  <IMG SRC="img/oscilloscope.jpg">
</CENTER>
</p>

Each node is represented by a line of different color (you can change the color
by clicking on it in the mote table). The x-axis is the packet counter number
and the y-axis is the sensor reading. To change the sample rate edit the
number in the "sample rate" input box. When you press enter, a message
containing the new rate is created and broadcast via the
<code>BaseStation</code> node to all nodes in the network. You can clear all
received data on the graphical display by clicking on the "clear data" button.

<p> The <code>Oscilloscope</code> (or <code>Sense</code>) application displays
the raw data as signalled by the <code>Read.readDone()</code> event. How the
values are to be interpreted is out of scope of the application, but the GUI
let's you adapt the visible portion of the y-axis to a plausible range (at the
bottom right).
