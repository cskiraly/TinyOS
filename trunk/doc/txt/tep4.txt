.. Note::

   This document specifies a Best Current Practices for the
   TinyOS Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.  This memo
   is in full compliance with [TEP_1]_.


1. Introduction
====================================================================

In order to document the Active Message Type [1]_, also known as
Active Message Identifier (AM ID), used by the protocols and to
prevent AM ID conflicts between applications and protocols distributed
with TinyOS 2.x, the application and protocol developers MUST use AM
IDs in the appropriate range. The network protocol implementors MUST
use AM ID allocated by the Network Protocol Working Group for the
specific protocol. The application developers MUST use AM IDs from the
unreserved pool.

2. Current Allocations
====================================================================

The unreserved pool is in the range 128-255 (0x80-0xFF). The reserved
pool is in the range 0-127 (0x00-0x7F).

2.1 Unreserved pool (0x80 - 0xFF)
---------------------------------

When an application uses the AM ID in the range 128-255, it is
guaranteed to not conflict with AM IDs used by the protocols
distributed with TinyOS 2.x. These IDs may conflict with the protocols
in the contrib tree or other applications. No allocation request is
necessary to use AM IDs in this range.

2.2 Reserved pool (0x00 - 0x7F)
-------------------------------

When a protocol uses an allocated AM ID in the reserved pool, it is
guaranteed to not conflict with AM IDs used by applications or other
protocols that also use an allocated AM ID. The AM ID may conflict
with the protocols and applications in the contrib tree.

Here is a list of current allocations::

  * 0x70 - 0x7F are reserved for collection protocols maintained by
    the Network Protocol Working Group.

    0x70 - CTP routing beacon and LEEP (''tos/lib/net/ctp'', TEP 119, 123, and 124)
    0x71 - CTP data packets (''tos/lib/net/ctp'', TEP 119, 123)
    0x72 - CTP debug messages (''tos/lib/net/ctp'')
    0x73 - MultiHopLQI routing beacon (''tos/lib/net/lqi'')
    0x74 - MultiHopLQI data packets (''tos/lib/net/lqi'')
    0x75 - MultiHopLQI debug messages (''tos/lib/net/lqi'')

  * 0x60 - 0x6F are reserved for dissemination protocols maintained by
    the Network Protocol Working Group.

    0x60 - Drip (''tos/lib/net/drip'', TEP 118)
    0x61 - DIP (''tos/lib/net/dip'', TEP 118)

  * 0x50 - DYMO (''tos/lib/net/dymo'') maintained by the Network
    Protocol Working Group.

  * 0x3F - TinyOS NALP code (TEP 125) reserved by the Core Working
    Group.


3. Requesting AM ID Allocation
====================================================================

The Network Protocol Working Group will maintain a list of all the
allocations in the reserved range.

Developers whose protocols will be included within the ''tos''
directory MUST receive AM ID allocation from the Network Protocol
Working Group. This allocation policy applies to software and
protocols maintained by any working group.

To receive an AM ID allocation, please send an email to the chair of
Network Protocol Working Group with the following information:
  * Working Group responsible for the protocol
  * Name of the protocol and relevant TEPs
  * Location of the protocol in TinyOS source tree

Upon receiving this information, the chair of the Network Protocol
Working Group will allocate an AM ID and update this TEP.

4. Reclaiming the AM ID Allocation
====================================================================

When the working group responsible for maintaining the protocol with
an allocated AM ID obsoletes the protocol, the chair of the working
group should send a deallocation request to the chair of the Network
Protocol Working Group. The chair of the Network Protocol Working
Group will update this TEP by deleting the entry for the obsolete
protocol.

5. Acknowledgments
====================================================================

Thanks to the TinyOS community at large for helping to formulate this
ID allocation policy.
