This directory contains "TKN15.4", a platform-independent IEEE 802.15.4-2006
MAC implementation. The code is in alpha state, under active development, but
most of the functionality described in the standard is implemented (and
cursorily tested). The MAC itself is platform-independent, but it requires
(1) a suitable radio driver, (2) Alarms/Timers with symbol precision and (3)
some "platform glue" code (defining guard times, etc.). Currently the only
supported platform is TelosB (however: without additional hardware support on
TelosB the timing in beacon-enabled mode is not standard compliant).

Status 6/16/08
--------------

Missing functionality:
- security (not planned)
- GTS (not planned)
- PAN ID conflict resolution
- multiple indirect transmissions to the same destination

Documentation
-------------

A technical report on TKN15.4 is under way and will be available at:
http://www.tkn.tu-berlin.de/publications/reports.jsp

Implementation 
--------------

MAC implementation: tinyos-2.x/tos/lib/mac/tkn154
MAC interfaces: tinyos-2.x/tos/lib/mac/tkn154/interfaces
CC2420 driver: tinyos-2.x/tos/chips/cc2420_tkn154
TelosB "platform glue" code: tinyos-2.x/tos/platforms/telosb/mac/tkn154
Example applications: tinyos-2.x/apps/tests/tkn154

Note: TEP3 recommends that interface names "should be mixed case, starting
upper case". To match the syntax used in the IEEE 802.15.4 standard the
interfaces provided by the MAC to the next higher layer deviate from this
convention (they are all caps, e.g. MLME_START).
